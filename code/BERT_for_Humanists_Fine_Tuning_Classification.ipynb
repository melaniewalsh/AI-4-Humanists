This book though was absolutely fantastic. I loved it! I thought it was cute, the illustrations were wonderful and the ending, god, it was hilarious. Great book and I look forward to more.\", 'This book, as all the other books by David Shannon is very funny and rateable. Both parents and their kids will love this.', '(3.5)', 'This one was probably one of my favorites of the whole Harry Potter series. \\n J.k. Rowlings writing was awesome', 'Move Over, Rover! is a book that helps remind readers to \"read like a detective.\" It was fun to see the animals piling into the dog house. The predictable refrain was cute and I thought I was getting a book that would be fun to pair with Jan Brett\\'s The Mitten, but I was blindsided. I had missed a few very important details in the pictures. \\n I loved that the author caught me napping. I immediately flipped to the beginning of the book to see how I had let some facts get by me. This is going to be a great book to share with my students. I am betting that some of them will be more alert to the illustrations than I was. I am a text kind of gal most of the time.', 'Not my favourite Beatrix Potter as a child, but the art, as always, is wonderful.', \"Children's book perfection. The artwork is spot on.

A blue stone went on its life journey to see the world, to become something else, to accompany someone, to experience love and loneliness, to be watched and discarded, and to witness different scenes of others\\' lives. Finally, it returned to \"where it has always belonged\" (unpaged). My eyes welled up with tears as reading through this book. Being a traveler away from home, I somehow became the blue stone. Honestly, this book makes me fall into a state of melancholy, which also makes me understand more clearly about the rise and the ebb, the death and the birth of life. The beautiful water color illustration is a eye feast!', 'A very good book, for kids. I love how Henry stays clean, throughout the day, but everyone else gets dirty, because of Henry.', \"I really enjoyed reading this book, I thought that this was definitely the strongest books out of the three I have read, I thought that the characters were developed a lot more and overall I just found this book a whole lot more interesting and enjoyable to read. \\n The plot. I thought that the plot in this was really interesting. I thought that it was really fast paced and I think if I hadn't already seen the movie it would have kept me guessing the whole way through and I weould have found a lot of things that I wouldn't have seen coming. But sadly, I have already seen the movie so I wasn't all that suprised by the plot though there were a few differences and parts of the plot were explained a lot more which I found explained a lot of parts in the movie that I didn't understand. Overall I thought that the plot was great, I judt wished I got to the book before I watched the movie! \\n The characters. I loved how we got to see the existing charatcers grow throughout this book and also how we got introduced to new characters. I still have problems with Harry's character even after reading the third book, there is just something about his character that I really can't relate to and I just find to annoy me. I found Hermione's character was a lot better in this better in this book because she started to go along with Harry and Ron in breaking the rules which I liked. As always I still love Ron's character, he's always made me laugh throughout the books and this book was no exception. Now onto the new characters. I really liked Professor Lupin's character I thought that he was written brilliantly and we really got to see what his character was like, I loved his character the whole way through the book and he was a character that really made me enjoy this book a lot more. I also loved Sirus Black's character, I love how throughout most of the book he's portrayed as this mad villan, then we get to see what he's really like. \\n Overall I really enjoyed this book, it has definitely got to be my favourite book of the three I have read so far and I can;t wait to start reading the next book.\", \"I *LOVE* that Frederick the Mouse is valued for his artistic and poetic contributions to his mouse family! One of my favorite (new-to-me) kids' books!\", 'A beautiful Christmas story!', \"AFTER THE FIRST READING: \\n There are a lot of things I enjoyed about this book. Above all, it's the fact that Roald Dahl writes this story from a child's perspective. What can be done or not, what is possible or not and what is important or not, always seems to be weighed from the four-year-old Matilda herself. \\n Some aspects of this book - like the harsh portray of Matilda's parents and the unrealistic solution of the little girl's problems at the end of the book lessened my enthusiasm about this book a tiny bit. But then again, it's the truthfulness and the slightly fantastic point of view from which this book is written that I enjoyed so much. \\n AFTER THE SECOND READING: \\n Okay. I'll admit it. I have become obsessed witht his story. After watching the movie and seing parts of the musicals online, I can say that I have totally embraced the story and I love it to pieces. Matilda is amazing. I love the way she sees the world, I love how unique and strong she is. I love her obsession with books and learning. She's just an amazing and extraordinary little girl. I also love Miss Honey. She is the teacher I wish I had and she is the person I'd like to become once I'm done studying at university. I won't become a teacher, but a social worker. Still she is what I want to become to the children I will take care of once. \\n I love how Matilda's magical powers make so much more sense in the book than they do in the movie. I am still a bit doubtful about the sudden ending with Matilda living with Miss Honey. Still I absolutely LOVE everything else about this book. That's why I changed the rating from 4 to 5 stars. I'm sure I'll read this again soon.\", 'Even after all this time, Prisoner of Azkaban is still one of my favorites in the series! I always loved it because it seemed like the only \"happy\" book in the series in my opinion. For once, Harry doesn\\'t have to fight off Voldemort, and he meets Lupin and Sirius, who are the first family he encounters besides the Dursleys. I used to read this book over and over again when I was younger because it always made me smile. But now whenever I try to reread the series, I usually just read the last two for the sake of time. It\\'s nice to finally go back and read from the beginning again after so much time away.', 'This is a new addition to our school library. I needed some new Easy Readers. I like that the main character, Dirk Bones, is a skeleton. It reminds me of Skulduggery Pleasant which is for middle grade readers. I like how the plot is simple yet engages readers to figure out the mystery. And the character are cute. The pictures are colorful and expressive, too. Should be a good choice for new readers!', 'Sweet celebration of ingenuity and friendship with lovely collage illustrations.', \"I've never really understood people's fascination with dinosaurs, so it's impressive that this book held my attention. I learned a ton and was pushed to think about dinosaurs in new ways. This is appropriate for upper elementary and middle school students and would make an excellent mentor text for scientific nonfiction. A tad long, so students will probably need support to stay on track and fully comprehend this detailed book.\", 'Charlie Laird, his brother Jack and friends are back in this brand new adventure.

Can they stop this dark force before their worlds of sleep cease to exist and the town of Cypress Creek become a target next?

If you enjoy young adult fantasy books, then definitely check this one out. It is available at your local library and wherever books are sold.', \"I originally read The Giver a few years back and reread it just today. This time, I found it even more compelling, having not to acclimate myself to Lowry's stark style and heavy exposition (in the early chapters) on the workings of Jonas' sterile, dystopian society. These details are revealed through the 11-year-old's musings of his daily and family life while looking expectantly toward the Ceremony of the Twelves, when he (and all other 12-year-old children) will learn their adult occupations within in the community. \\n Not until chapter 8 (23 total), when Jonas finally learns what is to be his select and singular role, does the story gain a momentum that grows with each passing chapter, racing toward a spectacular end. \\n At the Ceremony of the Twelves Jonas learns that he is to become the Receiver of Memories, memories denied a populace pampered and disciplined like pets. Jonas alone is to receive (from the old and ailing Giver) all the wretched and wonderful memories of times past, before society accepted 'Sameness' as a doctrine for living. But in turning from strife and decision-making, the people abandoned emotional depth--even depth in perceptions, so that only the Giver and Receiver can perceive color or feel emotions of love or hate. And with his awakening to pain and joy, Jonas finds himself on a road to either oblivion or freedom. \\n The Giver is a companion book to two subsequent stories of dystopian societies, Gathering Blue and Messenger. I read both of these immediately after first reading The Giver. Can you guess which book I'll be reading next?\", 'Not sure on this one.....good in places and easy to read but I like a story that goes somewhere and this really does not do that! I skipped a few bits and did not lose track of the story......', \"I read so many books so quickly so long ago, I can't remember what they were about anymore. Give me a second. \\n This one was written in email format. Kind of nice. Kind of annoying as they are like 12 years old? The 2nd book in the series in which I never read the first one (again). The girls live in different towns and are totally different yet best friends. Girl #1 (since I can't remember names) lives with her parents who are having a baby. Girl #2's dad left her family in the first book and is an alchoholic and is simi-stalking the family. Issues insue. The drunk father ends up dead in the end of the book and for some reason, at the time, that totally effected me reading that. I didn't cry in the library, since I was in public, but when I got home that night, for some reason, I just had a good cry. I hadn't cried since I got here and I just needed it. And for some reason, it was that that brought it on. \\n Grade: C\", 'This was a pretty quick read. I held my breath as the end got closer, waiting for the cheesy Hallmark ending where Joanie would realize she really had a crush on a boy and therefore couldn\\'t \"pretend\" to be a boy anymore and would come clean with her real feelings. Fortunately, it was never quite that bad. There are a few ending details that did piss me off for their heterocentricity (is that a word?) but it tries hard to give a \"be whoever you are\" message. Mainstream? Yes. Terrible? No. (In my opinion. Please feel free to tell me the reasons I should rethink that.)', \"Just like with the movie, I teared up in the end. There was so much more into the story than I thought. I understood that Leslie was seen as odd to the other students but since the movie is set up in a more modern time it lost that big sense on how much different she really way. The time was set after a war (I can't remember which one it was) but the time period was different from the movie had set it up. The music teacher was actually seen as a hippie. But what I liked about the movie was the focus on the relationship between Leslie and Jess. The friendship. And the young imagination. Beautiful. Two kids, despite their struggles in the real life, still hold their spirits as kids. What I liked about the book was the depth it went to in kids struggles. The movie had a nice balance in presenting the good happy moments and the struggles. But the book hold so much more. Two different people, both facing with struggles in their lives, saved each other. A story of friendship and how much a gift of a friend can go so far. \\n A book that every child should read. Everyone, of all ages, should read this books.\", 'What an amazing set of books... All young adults should be required to read these books. It gives off a warm feeling and teaches you the value of family and life.', 'How timely here in August 2017 to have a picture book that addresses the question of ownership of the Moon. The full moon of August 2017 is especially stunning and during August the moon will eclipse the Sun in an amazing display. As our interest in the Moon turns our eyes heavenward, it is appropriate for children to learn much about the Moon and to give reason to the fact that the Moon is not his or hers and that it belongs to everyone. \\n I love how the story is told in short lines of lyric verse that flow easily throughout. The illustrations in black ink against white with stunning blues, black, and brilliant water colors are integrated to capture the darkness that is \"the night\" and the colors one might see throughout the universe should light penetrate. \\n Though the curious cat sees and envisions the moon as possibly his own, he is soon set straight in his thinking by the bird, tree, stars, and sky who all claim it is theirs and for their own specific reason for claiming ownership. Eventually, though, the Moon sets everyone straight in stating that he is no one\\'s and that his glow is for everyone, everywhere. \\n A grand opportunity for parents and teachers to share with young readers and listeners to the story that all that is in nature is everyone\\'s to enjoy and appreciate - the sun, moon, stars, clouds, light, dark, air, wind, warmth, etc. \\n A lovely book for ages 3 to 7. \\n DISCLOSURE: I received an advance review galley copy from Random House to facilitate a review. Opinions are my own and freely given.', 'Love Dr. Seuss books! This one was definitely a tongue twister! It was great to read!', \"I still have the puffin edition of this book that I read 100 years ago. The way the line between dreams and reality is blurred fascinated and haunted me. I love this book. I should reread it. I'd like to revisit all the seminal books of my young reading life, and see what my impressions are now.\", 'These are the third and fourth books in this board book series which pairs a larger board book with an inset small book. The larger book has the images of the adults with the story, and the small book has the images and noises of the babies. The pages turn independently and work best when you have small hands helping you. Sturdy and with the fun aspect of mixing and matching, these books are beautifully designed with very accessible illustrations.', \"Mahatma Gandhi's grandson tells how he has tried to live his live as light.\", 'In following up with the author (with showing interest in my title), I noticed her title and was really bewitched by its cover art for some reason. Then, with reading some other reviews and coming to find out it is a short tale, I decided to purchase it for leisure. As I am not a reader per se--at least not beyond news, research and general interests stuff--I thought and found this title\\'s length would fit me, especially for one sitting, like on a cold, wet rainy New Year\\'s day. :) \\n With that, I like Amber in the World of Shades and as it unfolded, I found myself chuckling from the expressive characters and their interactions. Their story, as complex as it is, is told in an uncomplicated and straight-forward manner. It makes for the kind of story one may tell or read to a child at bed time. \\n Riya\\'s style has moments of sheer linguistic beauty (in terms structure) and uses particular vocabulary at the right time for impact--or so I thought. And to top it off, AWS has a nice moral lesson of life-being-10%-of-what-happens-to-you-and-90%-of-how-you-respond. It is obvious the Riya trusts a reader to intelligently suspend reality and enjoy it for what is, and I would recommend one to do so. \\n Also, as one dives into the story, don\\'t let \"Precious\" fool you. :) Though it was a momentary thought, this work is not Lord of the Rings-based (or at least I don\\'t think it is). What is definite is that Riya makes the story about the main character, Amber. Thus the title. To this, it is clear that Riya uses love and various forms of it as the source of Amber\\'s struggles and motivations. This has allowed for originality with the story\\'s plot and conflict. \\n The only (constructive) criticisms I do have are: \\n 1) with the handling of time\\'s elapse in the story. For me, it was off and made for points of re-reading. (Of course, to help with this critique, the best flow of time presented is between chapters 5 and 6); \\n 2) the cover story toward the end... it felt like a stretch that prolonged the story unnecessarily; but I figured it has a purpose toward the second book in the series; \\n 3) on technical note of format, the section which begins \"Liked Amber\\'s story?\" should have started on a new page; \\n and oh, 4)--which I left out of the Amazon review--is Gina. I felt the mystery buildup to her revelation was lacking; it just felt all of sudden in the intensity of the moment; \\n and also 5), an excerpt of the first chapter of second book would have been better than the whole first chapter. \\n In short, though the story could benefit from refinement a smidgen more, it is a good and delightful story simply told. (That\\'s a thumbs up.)', 'Enjoyable, but rather bland. Neither the sentence-level writing, nor the big picture were particularly distinguished, and a few aspects of the plot seemed odd. A beauty pageant that is \"a big deal\" only has ten contestants, and only three of them are still in the running after the first round - and all of the appear to be under 13? That seems odd to me, though I readily admit that I know nothing about beauty pageants. I predicted from the beginning what was going to happen with Lucky\\'s money, though I didn\\'t see how they were going to resolve Lucky\\'s problem, and did like that aspect of the book. After putt so much time into discussing how nervous Salma was about the pageant, and the pageant in general, there was very little thought about the aftermath. How did she feel about not winning (which I thought was a nicely realistic touch, the book would have been too sentimental if she had won)? I liked the book and would recommend it to readers who enjoy sweet and gentle stories, particularly animal lovers.', \"Brilliant in quality, but I found it terrifying as a child.

When a golden chest full of yarn is discovered \"For Roselupin,\" with the message that she should \"Knit what you want,\" the king suggests that she knit him a nice scarf. But Roselupin takes all the red yarn and knits herself a wolf suit, which when she put it on, causes her to grow into a real, enormous red wolf. She escapes from the tower and is appeased with food from the villagers. Everyone thinks the princess has been eaten by the wolf. But when the villagers go to the forest to seek the missing wolf, they find a long skein of read yarn tangled among the trees and Roselupin asleep. The king immediately puts her in and even higher tower and once again suggests that she knit him a nice scarf. Instead, she knits him a mousy pair of pajamas, causing the king to turn into a mouse, after which Roselupin is freed from her tower.', \"I really enjoyed this book! The storyline of a magical dreamland may not be the most unique, but the inventive descriptions and the added fun of the narration really does put a fresh feel to this story. Segel's narration really adds a lot to the audio version - it is a genuine performance that really makes it all the more fun! He has a great range for all of the different characters and voices. \\n And I think that, despite the youth of the main character, this is a book that will appeal to a wide range of ages - from the old to the young.

So here goes: \\n Matilda is a know-it-all, but she is so humble about her intelligence that you can't help but to love her. The unjust situations she finds herself in - being called a cheat for being able to do complex arithmetic in her head, being accused of the newt in the water incident, etc. - make you instantly feel for her. Everyone feels that they have been unjustly accused at some point or another, which makes it all the more easy to relate to this. She becomes real. Life is not easy for her, despite her high level of intelligence. She has to make due with what talents she was born with. \\n The over-exaggerated cruelty of Miss Trunchbull makes you feel like things could be worse while also showing you that no matter how bad things get, you can always find a way to make them better. Despite how cruel and evil Miss Trunchbull is, a young child is still able to best her. If this isn't inspiring, I don't know what is. \\n Another thing I love about this book is Roald Dahl's use of words. He uses words I would be too timid to put in a children's book out of fear of them not understanding the words. But isn't that part of why children read? They want to learn new words. And a book with some big words in it makes you feel like you have accomplished something, like you are a grownup. And in the case of Matilda, big words go perfectly with her character. \\n To sum it up, I think this book continues to be a favorite because the characters are well developed, the plot is fantastical but still believable, and Roald Dahl respects his readers. Nothing is dumbed down. All of these things make, not only a successful chlidren's book, but a successful book in general.\", \"Distinctive 3-D and drawn scenes and characters will intrigue readers, perhaps even distract from the initial reading of the story. It's well worth repeated readings and viewings to appreciate the complexity of the text and visual detail.

Then as the sun sets, the father returns spend time with his family and eventually sails off to the lake again. The mother and baby sit on the shore, watching the night and the lights on the boats.

Celie is the youngest in the Valentine family, and she often feels that she is wronged because so much is going on: the Grandma she adores seems to be suffering from early Alzheimer's, her 6th grade sister has a cellphone now and spends even less time with Celie, her sister is also a pre-teen and prone to tantrums and dramatic outbursts, and her Mom and Dad are overwhelmed with Grandma's rapidly deteriorating mental health.

Celie reacts badly to so many situations that seem to be more than she can handle, and she writes it all down in her diary, which the reader gets to read as well as admire Celie's artistic interpretation of what she is feeling and what is going on around her. Celie handles friendship and family as best she can, she makes mistakes, has someone to point her down the correct path, she gets angry, she apologizes, she learns from her mistakes, and through it all, the reader gets to empathize, make connections, and learn from Celie's experiences, that are realistic because of their every day family and school life likeness.\", 'I like the message of this book , but there is too much text and the writing feels clunky.

Pitched at the middle to upper primary age range, the book takes an engaging look at the first Australian cricket team to tour England. I found the story fascinating as an adult reader, with plenty of questions springing to my mind - not least of which, why is this event not more widely acknowledged and why are Indigenous people nowadays conspicuous only by their absence from our national cricket teams? - and I\\'m sure young cricket fans will get a kick out of seeing cricket \"in the olden days\". (No Rocket Man at these matches!) \\n The story has an incredibly subtle undertone that depicts aspects of life for indigenous people of the time. While the team is received well as cricketers, there is still an undercurrent of \"look at the performing natives\" that is conveyed through the text and imagery. I can imagine the book being used to excellent effect in the classroom to stimulate discussion around the social issues of the time - how would the men have felt, being lauded for their sporting skills, but not counted as citizens? Did circumstances change for the men when they returned to Australia? Did the men feel the trip was worthwhile, considering the death of one of their teammates? \\n The presentation of the book is gorgeous, with Terry Denton\\'s illustrations bringing the text to life. The beautiful map that adorns the front endpapers is matched by the final endpapers depicting images of each of the team members, with their names, nicknames and a piece of information about their role in the team. It\\'s hard to imagine Terry Denton as a separate entity from the Griffiths/Denton Juggernaut, but it\\'s wonderful to appreciate a more realistic illustrative style in this tome. \\n I will admit to enjoying this book enormously as an adult reader and being drawn in to the mystery of this event being lost in the annals of time. I\\'m interested in finding out more - did these men have descendants? If so, what do they think of their great-grandfathers\\' sporting achievements? Could their perspectives have been included in this book somehow? \\n I think the mark of a good non-fiction book is to stimulate further curiosity about the topic. Boomerang and Bat has certainly achieved this for me as an adult reader and I can see it doing the same for mini-fleshlings. Teachers in particular, get your grabby hands on this one and get it into your classrooms: stimulating discussion will be guaranteed!', 'A simple story about a boy who finally finds value in his individuality.', 'can\\'t believe this was the first Roald Dahl book I\\'ve ever read. \" But where, you might ask, is this book that the BFG wrote?

She was a London lady born and bread and she loved her London home that overlooked London square. It was here that she had her only friend, a boy with a feather in his hat named Robin, but according to Miss Heliotrope he only imaginary. \\n Upon the death of her long absent father Maria became an orphan, and so her governess Mrs Heliotrope, Wiggins and herself were to leave London and move to the unrefined and ill-comforted country to a place called Moonacre to live with her last remaining relative, her cousin Sir Benjamin. \\n But what Maria finds at Moonacre is not at all what she expected, the country is a beautiful and enchanting place to live and its people are so nice that Maria finds that she instantly loves them all. But there is a darkness hanging over Moonacre and nothing is what it seems, especially not a little white horse and a large dark dog. \\n The Little White Horse is a symbol for purity and it is exactly Maria's pure heart and bravery that drives this classic story of morality, friendship and love. The wrongs of the past must be healed before those in the present are truly to be happy, and only through the actions of one girl can peace be found at last. Although set in the past it is a sweet and timeless story that has been enjoyed for generations, and will continue to bring joy for generations to come.\", 'I picked this book for my first Toddler Storytime.

This could be done for a storytime and then do a really cute cat craft.', \"I picked this up because it was recommended to readers who enjoyed A Tale Dark & Grimm on Amazon. I loved the humor and the quirky twist on the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel in A Tale Dark and Grimm, and I just plain love fairy tales, so I am looking for innovative, interesting retellings of these classic stories. I'm glad my library had this on audio. It was a fun and quick read, about 3 hours (It took me longer because I listened in spurts). \\n Initially, I was very drawn in. The characters of Sol and Connie are captivating, their story was somewhat poignant. I definitely felt for these kids. If you're familiar with Hansel and Gretel, you can get a head start on the storyline, although McGowan throws in some novel touches that were fun. I won't say which, because that's the fun of reading it. Sol is a young genius and inventor who gets a huge blow to his confidence that he has to work through. His mischievous, free-sprited, and intuitive sister Connie carries a burden of guilt related to Sol's greatest failure. This is a pivotal element of this story, and the author does carry it through successfully to the end. The story shows what the child-eating witch is up to in the modern age, and she's definitely streamlined her operation. \\n The child-eating witch is truly heinous. What makes it even more harrowing is that people actually volunteer their kids to be eaten because of the manifold failings of those kids! Definitely folks who shouldn't have reproduced! It's humorous, but on one level it's really kind of disturbing that parents would set their children up to be eaten by a witch just because they misbehave or fail to live up to certain standards. I think that they are even worse than the witch, honestly. \\n This is one of those books that won't appeal if you don't like a dark and kind of twisted sense of humor. Let me just say that here and now. But I think readers who like the Hansel and Gretel story won't find anything here that countermands the original story. Instead, this is just a modern update with more humor. \\n If there was anything I was underwhelmed with, it was the use of the secondary character who happened to be a witch as well, but she's a good witch. I understand why she couldn't help the kids very much, but I still feel she was underutilized in the story. I also wished there was some sort of confrontation between her and the evil witch. Also, I feel the ending was too abrupt. I know this is supposed to be a short book, but I wasn't fully satisfied with the ending. I definitely wanted more story and more closure. \\n Overall, this was pretty good. It's hard to rate it higher or to perform a very intensive analysis, because it's very short. I am glad this was recommended to me because I liked A Tale Dark and Grimm. However, it doesn't live up to the excellence of that book, and that's one caveat I would give any reader who is investigating humorous, middle grade/juvenile fairy tale retellings. \\n As far as suitability for young readers, I think it's fine for kids who are 8-12 (or older readers who like J/MG fiction). However, this would be too scary for a younger reader. Not that much is described, but the idea of a witch eating bad kids or even worse, their parents giving them away to the witch, is pretty disturbing, even for a much older reader like myself. \\n If you are able to get this on audiobook, I recommend it. I liked the narrator. \\n Overall rating: 3.25/5.0 stars.\", 'jmyl wbsyT wmbhr f~ nfs lwqt', \"Whoops, I read them out of order - no wonder I was confused!

Confusing.', \"Thank you to Goodreads and the author Amra Pajalic for providing me with a copy of this book. \\n Amir: Friend On Loan tells the story of Amir and Dragan, best friends living in Australia but with different ethnic backgrounds. This has never been a problem for their friendship, until the 'Serbs' invade Bosnia. Dragan is from Serbia and Amir from Bosnia. This causes all kinds of problems with their families and friends, and the boys find themselves not allowed to be friends anymore. \\n I thought this book would go on to prove that ethnic backgrounds should not be any reason for kids not be friends, but instead got the opposite. Amir and Dragan try to be friends without their parents knowledge but the pressure is mounting from their schoolmates, who are divided. I know that this sort of thing happens, and I know that when you have family in a country being invaded it's going to be hard for you. But why on earth take your anger out on people who no longer live in that country? Australia is a land of peace and prosperity and it's doors are open. There is such a wide diversity of backgrounds and we should all be able to live peacefully here in a country where there is no war. I thought it interesting that Amir identified himself as Australian - and why shouldn't he - but yet was dragged into a war he had no interest in by his parents and other parents in the community. \\n I was disappointed in the ending of this book. I felt the author could have done so much more with it, the fact that it is marketed to younger readers shouldn't make it short, and expanded these issues far more than she did and leave the young readers with a positive impression of how to overcome differences in the community and an understanding that everyone is different, but here we are all Australian. Instead, it felt a bit like, bad luck, no hope for you. I know there are places where this happens, but why not use your book to help bridge a gap and show that we are all the same? In a week where we happen to be celebrating and calling out for diverse books and characters, it especially feels like the author dropped the ball on this one. So much potential to really write some lessons for children of all ages, races and religions to be able to learn from. \\n 2.5 Stars.\", \"I can't remember what I didn't like - the book, or the group project they put me in :x\", 'Very cute book in a calendar format about a year in the life of a rabbit and to help students visualize a specific mathematical problem.', \"let's fly!

In honor of her popularity and the book's tenth anniversary, this picture book is being reissued. It is absolutely hilarious and just as fun now as it was then. The author cleverly takes readers through the alphabet four different times, once in a list of unpalatable foods available for Kitty, which sends her into misbehavior mode as she alphabetically causes problems in the house to show her displeasure. The last two trips involve a list of the food her human has purchased for Kitty to eat, which are much more to her liking, and cause her atone for her sins. The bright illustrations show a great familiarity with cats and their antics when they are displeased---mine kick the litter and its contents completely out of the box when I am away from home for an extended amount of time--but also an enormous love and respect for this funny, disdainful cat. Perhaps this cautionary ABC book will keep human companions from ever running out of the food their kitties love. As a bonus, this edition even has a huge poster of Bad Kitty.\", 'such a good book.

Myracle continues to deliver the goods for middle graders. Keep 'em coming!\", \"There are so many babies on the Bayou! From fuzzy ducklings to tiny raccoons, little lives are everywhere we look. \\n The illustrations are charming, and the text is great, too.

Seemingly fierce animals such as alligators turn out to be quite tender with their offspring.

It is a story about friendship and the many forms it comes in. Friendship isn't based upon physical similarities and it's not a tit-for-tat or equivalent exchange that is the foundation of Charlotte and Wilbur's relationship. Something that I feel is lost in this day and age.\", \"Oh my gosh, if these books had existed when I was a kid, I think I would have died with happiness. I would have adored the gothic, spooky atmosphere, the humor, the persona of the author, the cooking, the biting baby, and the use of the library. As an adult, I love them for all the same reasons, but I think I see more depth to them that they continue the tradition of bleak Victorian literature. I love that they can't really be classified: they feel like fantasy novels, but there's nothing really fantastic in them; they seem Victorian, but there's talk of cars and other modern machines - and they're certainly not steampunk; they could be American or European. It's just pure atmosphere, which I'm realizing more and more is my biggest draw to a book. Lemony Snicket (tee hee hee) is so skilled in creating this world and making the Baudelaire children feel like fleshed out characters, like they have a history as a family, even though the novel is quite short. I can see how Count Olaf's real cruelty towards the orphans could bother some readers and parents, but for me, this book is perfect. It's like The Wolves of Willoughby Chase was written by Edward Gorey, and I can't get enough.\", 'Great dragon descriptions, barbarian descriptions, and illustrations. I laughed a lot.

In order to get him dressed, his father puts underwear on his head and asks if that is right. Climbing in the car window, gets him to get into the car quickly. Juggling carrots leads to the boy eating them eagerly. This is inspiration for parents, especially fathers, to get silly to get things done. \\n This positive and silly parenting style is a pleasure to read about. It got me thinking about the antics we would undergo when my sons were in preschool and Kindergarten. Laughter is a great way to speed getting dressed along. I always ended up with rabbit ears made out of sweatpants and my toes peeking out of tiny sleeves. \\n It is also nice to see a father depicted as this involved with his child and the mother making appearances but not as a featured character. There is no instance where the dad is not the one dealing confidently and positively with his son. Very refreshing to see. \\n Shea is the author of several successful picture books. His writing is filled with great short sentences that are simple but also filled with humor and a sense of fun. His illustrations are bright colored, simple and modern. This round blue family is sure to be a hit with preschoolers. \\n A perfect Father's Day read, this is also a great book to read aloud just for laughs. Guaranteed to get you and your audience giggling. Appropriate for ages 3-5.\", 'Quick and easy read that is also quite provacative!', \"I think this might be one of the most important books I read as a kid. It instilled in me an appreciation for female protagonists, and even more, for female protagonists who don't need a man to make them complete. It's a wonderful message to send to both women and men, that women can be completely independent. It sends the message for girls to take risks, speak their mind, and to never, ever let a man determine their self-worth. It's a truly special story, and one I think every kid should read.\", 'A lot of little girls I have known have gone to ballet \"classes\" where they wear sparkly tutus and prance about but don\\'t learn bubkes about dance.

See Jeremy has exceptional digging skills from all his sandcastle building and the pirates are in need of a digger to help them find their treasure! \\n The book is a good mix of adventure and the home life. The pirates don't make him eat his veggies and they don't expect table manners. On the other hand, he doesn't have a comfy bed or someone to tuck him in. I liked that the pirate life gave Jeremy reasons to want to go home. So often the adventures are so fantastic that there's no reason for the protagonist to go back home and yet he usually does. \\n It's a good start to the classic tale of a young boy befriended by pirates.

And Anne\\'s ability to seek out \\'kindred spirits\\' irrespective of age or gender barriers. I also loved how loyal Anne stayed in her friendship to Diana. I always felt she outgrew her but Anne never lessened in her affection for her very first best friend. \\n - Anne is ambitious and competitive. Considering the era that the book was written in (circa 1908), I love how she is fiercely determined to prove herself. \\n - The books mix up fun times and sad times and draw you in so you experience them all fully. \\n - Matthew. I love how this shy, meek, old bachelor is won over so quickly by Anne\\'s impetuous ways. And Marilla. Slowly she lets her defences down and becomes a kinder, motherly figure. I love her growth in the book. \\n - Anne loves books and clothes equally. Just because people are bookworms doesn\\'t mean they only think about books. I love this mixture of her frivolous side and her bookish side. And who can ever forget Anne\\'s longing for those dresses with puff sleeves and the excitement when Matthew indulged her. \\n I could go on and on.

A story of learning to pause and find joy and kindness, of stepping into someone else's ray of sunshine.\", \"Book: Heartland: Beyond the Horizon \\n Author: Lauren Brooke \\n Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars \\n I used to read this series a lot and I loved the books. I own a lot of the earlier books, so I haven't gotten the chance to read very many where the characters are a little bit older. I love books that take place on a farm and in the country-since that is where I am from. I will say this and keep saying this: These are excellent books for tween girls (10-13 years old). \\n Amy comes back home for spring break and finds that it is really difficult to adjust to life at Heartland again. It seems like she is torn between her university life and her home life. She longs to have both, but feels that she really does not belong at home anymore. These are very realistic feelings, because most university students deal with these feelings at some point. Okay, here comes the kicker about Amy. Ready? I also noticed that Amy really did not age. She really does not have the maturely level of a university student. I don't know, but I really do not see any difference from this older Amy than the Amy that we were introduced to in Coming Home. \\n I really do like how the characters do seem to be going their own ways and starting their own lives, but it did seem a little childish to me. I don't know, but it just did not seem like the characters acted their age at all. Most people would not be okay with Amy taking off like she did, especially since she has not been home very much. In real life, I think that they would at least fight a little harder to keep her at home. \\n I was also disappointed with the cow drive. It was too simply and not very realistic. I am sorry, but Lauren Brooke needs to stay in Heartland and Terri Farley take care of the western stuff. Lauren is good at what she knows and it seems like that she really does not know all that much about running a western style ranch. Stay in Heartland and you will be golden! \\n It was your typical Heartland book, but the ending was really, really depressing and really simple. I don't know. I just would have thought that it would have been more emotional, but it was very dry and just too simply. I just would have thought that after all this time, there would have been a bite more drama. \\n Overall, still a good book, but it was just a little bit too simple for my liking. Amy and the characters just need to be allowed to age a little and I think we will really have something. Those of us who want to see Amy age do still have the TV show. However, tweens will eat this stuff up! It is right for their age level and maturity level!\", 'What a great short book...Kids and I all really enjoyed it~~', \"Before I write my review, I just want to say that this will be a different format since it is only 32 pages and it's a kids book. :) \\n Also reviewed on my blog! http://sassyanddangerous.blogspot.mx/ \\n When I came across this book, I thought it looked pretty cute. The minute I received this book, I started reading it and I enjoyed it. The story line was wonderful and it had a cute touch of family love. \\n I was, however, disappointed in the illustrations. I felt as though a little kid colored everything in and just handed it to the publisher. \\n This one didn't bother me at all because I find Indian names to be quite unique and easy for me to pronounce, but when you'reading this to a three or four year old, they will be too focused on how to actually pronounce the names instead of focusing on the story itself. \\n Overall, it was a quick, cute read and I recommend it to anyone of all ages.\", 'Beautifully written.

It was easy to distinguish between the characters based on their voices and how the narrator portrayed them. The performance gave the book that extra breath of life that really made it great. \\n Though this is a tough topic for kids, it is tackled well.

Enbrethiliel and I were talking about the changes made to the BSC books in these re-releases that I\\'ve been reading these past few weeks, and she commented that it would be difficult to re-release Dawn and the Impossible Three: \\n \"I think the reason Dawn and the Impossible Three doesn\\'t have a modernised version yet (and probably never will) is that even if they update all the details, they\\'ll never be able to touch the most dated bit of all without changing the entire novel. I mean Dawn\\'s frustration with her single mother and the single mother of the children she baby-sits the most. That strikes me as very 80s--as much a part of the decade as the satire of single mothers in Kindergarten Cop, The Karate Kid and even Who\\'s the Boss?\" \\n That conversation planted the seed for this entire series of reviews, and it also informed the way I read this particular volume. What I remembered, vaguely, before reading, was that Dawn\\'s mom was kind of scatterbrained, and that, on top of dealing with that, Dawn was also babysitting for a single mom - Mrs. Barrett - whose life was chaotic. I also remembered Marnie, the youngest of the so-called \"impossible three\" and her \"ham face\" as well as Buddy\\'s friendship with the Pike boys. I didn\\'t really remember much about the single motherhood theme, but as I read, it became clear that this entire book is about the difficulties faced by divorced moms. \\n And I guess the question is whether or not those difficulties were presented in a way that has become dated in the nearly 15 years since this book\\'s publication. \\n The BSC series represents several diverse family dynamics. Mary Anne\\'s father is a widower. Stacey\\'s parents are still married, but as we learn later in the series, perhaps not so happily. Kristy\\'s mother is divorced and preparing to remarry. Claudia\\'s parents are happily married. And then there\\'s Dawn, whose parents are divorced and live on opposite coasts. The babysitting charges also have different family situations, but I think Mrs. Barrett is the first single mom we meet outside of the babysitters\\' families. \\n What\\'s annoying about Mrs. Barrett is that she just can\\'t get it together. Her parenting skills are almost cartoonishly bad, and it\\'s pretty pathetic that she can be shown up by a thirteen-year-old babysitter. I have no idea why the kids are characterized as impossible in the title of this book, because they seem pretty well-adjusted for having such a scattered mother. It is Mrs. Barrett who makes Dawn\\'s life so difficult, not the kids. A lot of kids\\' books from the 80\\'s, especially ones written for tweens that I have come across in the used bookstore I frequent, have an obsession with the perils of divorced life. Pretty frequently they include mothers who just fall apart when their husbands leave, and the books also often blame the husband exclusively for the dissolution of the marriage. \\n I think this book, which was published in 1987, falls into that trap of portraying single mothers as helpless, fragile, and clueless. And for kids living in a 21st century world where non-traditional families are more and more prevalent, and single mothers are given so much credit for kicking butt and juggling work, family, and friends, I think this might seem unusual. It did seem out of place, even for me. \\n On the other hand, though, what did make this book interesting was the dilemma Dawn faced. Each BSC book up to this point has the girls facing a real-life babysitting challenge, and Dawn\\'s is that she has to find a way to stand up to a mother who is taking advantage of her. While it might be unfortunate that the adult who creates this challenge is a terrible representation of single mothers, the situation is engaging and Dawn\\'s ultimate decision to confront Mrs. Barrett might empower girls to create the same boundaries with people who try to take advantage of them. \\n I remember liking this book a lot more as a kid than I actually did this time around. I think girls who are hooked on the series will breeze through it and move right onto the next one without analyzing it too much. I would be interested to know, though, whether Dawn is as popular among fans of the series today as she was among the girls I hung out with in fourth and fifth grade, who loved her, while I loved Kristy and Mallory. I haven\\'t heard kids say much about it in the library, but this book was the hardest to get my hands on, since it gets checked out pretty often. I\\'m not sure if that says anything about its popularity, or if I just looked for it at the wrong time, but I guess it does indicate that there is at least a small audience still interested in reading it, despite how dated it might seem.', 'Totally fun and silly. Great to read with kids and unexpected.', 'Fun unique picture book the illustrations are particularly delightful.', \"The series gets better with each book.

Buck actually had a good life for awhile, but soon he was kidnapped and forced into a situation of hard labor, beatings, and pack hierachy. Proving the strong can survive, Buck unleashes the wildness in his beast, carrying the reader through a fascinating journey that ends on a beautiful note. \\n The short book goes through several stages. The hardest to endure is the initial kidnapping, selling, and seeing Buck have to work his way up through an unfriendly pack to lead a sleigh in the unfriendly Alaskan wildnerness. Not all dogs were as lucky, and that\\'s just sad. The second stage is when he sees an actual decent human again, and with the same strength that allowed his climb and survival against the other dogs, he gives the same strength of loyalty to his new two-legged friend. It\\'s a bleak book overall, especially for the good, so while the book doesn\\'t end up on a beautiful and happy note, it does end on another stage of Buck\\'s life where he fully embraces the peace of the wild. \\n London writes beautifully and he makes his characters fiercely legitimate, but ultimately I\\'m not seeing a pure focused point to the story other than a bleak and harsh adventure. Life is unfair, as Buck well knows, but he does the best he can with what he has, so perhaps this is the eventual point. \\n I can\\'t rate this five stars because there was too much turn-off with what the animals endured, and there are some rambling areas, but ultimately it\\'s a well-known classic worth visiting.', 'Story: 3 stars \\n Images: 2 stars \\n Actual: 2.5 stars', \"Superb.

They were either downright cruel (the infamous London Tower Zoo staged fights between the animals) or they were so sparse that the animals went insane. \\n This wonderfully-illustrated picture book introduces Bartlett, whose lifelong fascination with animals culminated in his becoming the head zookeeper at the London Zoo. In his early years, he had often visited zoos whose featureless, barren cages could be easily cleaned and showed off the animals--but had the side effect of seriously psychologically harming their residents. Bartlett began the move toward more naturalistic habitats, with toys and stimulation for the animals. He also wished to make the zoo a place of learning, and posted detailed facts about each animal near the cages. \\n True, zoos still had a long way to go. Basic nutrition was often a mystery for these exotic creatures. Animals were typically not captive-bred at this time, so they were caught in the wild and endured a no doubt grueling and terrifying trip to their destination. For each animal who arrived live, it's certain many others perished along the way. The book mentions the arrival of a single baby elephant but doesn't hint that the rest of the herd was probably shot to obtain the calf. \\n Zoos still have improvements to make, and this book naturally can't mention the grimmer history mentioned above. However, it does advance the idea that one dedicated person can make a tremendous difference in the lives of animals, and the animals' comfort, health and safety matter for their own sakes.\", \"The North Wind blows its magic as the author enchants readers with this sweet tale.

There are projects for young artists at any level. \\n The only thing I found confusing is that the book doesn't seem to start with the easiest lesson. It talks about Leonardo Da Vinci and on the opposing page it asks you to draw Mona Lisa's smile. It then goes on to ask the artist to copy a drawing and talks about drawing faces.

The library was magical and I have fond memories of libraries from Alaska to Germany and back again. My first internship was in a military library.

Pesan moral dan hikmah yang terkandung dalam setiap kisahnya (tentang kebaikan dan kejahatan), akan selalu relevan sepanjang masa. Jarang ada wilayah abu-abu dalam dongeng.

The change came in the spring, when Ellen and Karen were given a puppy. George would rest on the shelf for now.

As she enters her home listening to her mother\\'s beautiful voice, she witnesses an astounding site. Dog Tito and Mama are floating. Mama\\'s song from the opera, Carmen, acts \"like a golden staircase.\" \\n Soon Grandma comes for a visit and ends the foolishness. \"What would the neighbors think?\" she asks. So Mama gives up song and drops into a funk. \\n Floating on Mama\\'s Song is written in English and Spanish. Morales\\' watercolor art animates the characters. Lacamara bridges three generations and shows young readers how a tiny member of the family can have the opportunity to affect positive changes. I highly recommend this book for children of all ages.', \"Willa's mother is a very successful wedding planner, what could be cooler? However, it's not that cool for Willa. For starters, she's not allowed near her mothers' studio. Then there are all the rules, Mother expects great things from Willa. Having moved every couple of years for the first 12 years of her life, Willa has finally found somewhere she belongs. Now if she can only get her mother to fall in love with the guy next door, she may also get her wish....a father. I checked this book out from the young adult/teen section of my library, however I felt the writing was more suited to a younger age group. This is the kind of book I would have been reading around 4th grade. Don't get me wrong, the book was enjoyable and didn't take a lot of effort to read.\", 'This is the first Oz book claimed to have been written by Thompson (though I suspect the previous one was too, despite Baum\\'s name on it). It\\'s only okay. There are some interesting parts - the runaway country, for example, and the candle people. But a lot of it reminds me of what the Disney Channel does with Winnie the Pooh - if you throw in enough \"Hoo boohoo hoo!\" lines from Tigger, it sound like the story without having to have any substance. In this instance, it seems that characters are just there to establish that it\\'s an Oz story. The worst example is Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, whose sole function seems to be to make redundant rhymes out of whatever someone just said. In one case, she mentions the Tin Woodsman, but it seems an accident - he isn\\'t in the scene before or since, but he actually made it into the illustration for that page. \\n However, it was enjoyable enough to read. I would have given it three stars, since the plot was completely predictable - except for the final ending. I won\\'t spoil it, but it\\'s the reason WHY all the action took place, which I did not see coming.

And - eats were included.\" The two snickered, \"Oh yeah, we\\'re bad. We\\'re bad. We\\'re really, really bad.\" So they get into their sheep disguises and introduce themselves as being the Peep Sheep. You know, the ones who were lost and no one could find. The folk seem to be falling for this story except tough old Betty Mutton and she says: \"Just a minute. I knew the Peep Sheep. I grazed with the Peep Sheep. I counted with the Peep Sheep. And you two don\\'t leap like Peep Sheep.\" Well, the gig is up after the Bad Boys go through the sheep shearing line and end up naked \"big baa-aad wolves\". \\n Palatini has written a clever, funny tale about those big, bad wolves found in so many fairy tales.

Those answers are now published so more people can understand what it is like to have autism.

The prisoners were loud and vulgar which was not the examples the pastor wanted for his charges.

Cartea lui Geoff Rodkey mi s-a parut perfecta pentru circumstantele in care ma gaseam, si, ce sa vezi, povestea fratilor Tapper m-a relaxat si m-a inveselit, ba chiar am intins mana dupa pix sa iau cateva notite, ceea ce mi se intampla destul de rar la cartile pentru copii. \\n Claudia Tapper, in varsta de doisprezece ani, a scris o ,,istorie adevarata si oficiala\" a razboiul dintre ea si fratele geaman, Reese - razboi care i-a dat viata peste cap si a determinat-o sa-si calce in picioare principiile de copil studios si responsabil. Totul a inceput in cantina scolii, unde Reese a acuzat-o pe Claudia, in gura mare, ca a tras un part catastrofal, umilind-o in fata colegilor si mai ales a lui Jens, baiatul cel nou si foarte simpatic. Adanc ranita de atacul miselesc a fratelui geaman si dezamagita de pedeapsa usoara primita de acesta, Claudia planuieste sa-si faca singura dreptate, si uite-asa incepe un meci de farse in care sunt angrenati si alti colegi, iar sortii par sa incline cand intr-o parte, cand in alta, mai ales ca Reese se dovedeste a fi foarte greu de umilit si, de cele mai multe ori, nu isi da seama ce rautati pune la cale Claudia. \\n E drept ca, privind povestea din perspectiva unui cititor adult, am gasit si aspecte mai slabe: actiunea lancezeste in unele momente, farsele mi s-au parut cam putine si nu toate au fost amuzante, iar uneori am regasit si cateva clisee arhiprezente in filmele comerciale pentru adolescenti, precum grupul de fete rautacioase si cam prostute, preocupate doar de haine, barfe si, desigur, de a face viata amara grupului de fete destepte si de treaba, din care face parte si Claudia. Dar, daca e sa o luam asa, si clasica ciondaneala dintre o sora si un frate poate intra la categoria ,,clisee\". \\n ,,Fratii Tapper in razboi\" nu este atat de profunda si de antrenanta ca alte povesti pentru copii pe care le-am citit (,,Tabara\" si ,,Jocul lui Westing\" sunt doua dintre preferatele mele), insa cartea a fost o lectura simpatica si amuzanta, care a cuprins informatii de cultura generala si cateva lectii de viata strecurate subtil, fara a apela la un ton didactic. \\n Puteti citi aici recenzia mai lunga, scrisa pentru blog: http://lecturile-emei.blogspot.ro/201... \\n | Blog | Facebook | Instagram |', \"Can Patrick Stewart record every audio book?

But now her mother\\'s having a \"ding-dang baby\" and Gia\\'s worried about how this will change her relationship with her mom. Everywhere she goes, something reminds her of the impending birth - her mother talks about how the baby makes her crave pecan pie, her friends at school ask questions and give her looks, and her aunts and uncles make preparations, building cribs and talking about the future. Her cousin even comes over with her baby, and asks Gia to hold it! Finally, it just becomes too much, and Gia explodes with anger, only to have her mother reveal that she, too, will miss their time alone together. \\n This book is different from other \"mommy\\'s having a baby\" stories in a number of ways. For one thing, there\\'s no mention of a dad. His absence isn\\'t explained, but he\\'s definitely not in the picture. Also, we never actually see the baby. This isn\\'t a story of sibling rivalry per se, but a story about the changing relationship between a mom and her daughter as family dynamics shift. Gia is also a bit older than many of the siblings depicted in books in this genre, which makes this a nice title for school-aged kids expecting a new brother or sister. \\n Jacqueline Woodson\\'s writing is really beautiful. I could actually hear the characters\\' voices as they spoke their lines of dialogue, and I loved Gia\\'s repetition of \"ding-dang baby.\" I also loved all the references to the changing seasons: \"just as summer started leaving us...,\" \"jacket weather,\" and the leaves \"dropping off the trees.\" \\n The illustrations by Sophie Blackall also make this book stand out. As in The Red Lollipop, which I reviewed back in March, Blackall pays very careful attention to faces, bringing each character to life through very specific and unique details. On the pages where many characters appear - such as the spread where Gia and her friends jump rope, and the scene where all the students in the class sit to hear a story - I was impressed by all the differences in skin tone, hair texture, and even clothing style, that tell us all about the supporting cast without a single textual reference. \\n The illustrations also do some interesting things with perspective. At times, the viewer is zoomed all the way in on the action. At other times, tiny illustrations on either side of the text show different moments from the text. There is even one point where we watch Gia and her mom from outside the window, with an array of colorful leaves floating in our field of vision. \\n The best picture books are the ones where the illustrations expand upon the text and contribute to the story. This is certainly one of those books - I\\'ve read it twice so far, and each reading shows me something new to appreciate. An excellent picture book, and highly recommended.', 'Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book with my kids. We all laughed out loud.

It was definitely enjoyable to read but not extremely exciting. I was mostly interested to read on because of its influence in literature. So many stories are based on the stories of Robin Hood and so many references are made to them. \\n Because every chapter was pretty much a short adventure on its own it was easy to read only one chapter at a time and it was not one of those books I couldn't put down because I needed to know what happened next. \\n Although some of the characters in the book seem to be entirely bad persons, there are no characters that are entirely good. I was surprised at how often I thought Robin made a wrong decision. I liked Robin Hood a little less then I thought I would. He had a very agressive way of approaching people, so it was no wonder some of those people reacted really angry. Most of his encounters with others started out with a fight with sticks. Eventhough it was funny in the beginning I honestly got a little bored with it over time and also a lot of the stories just seemed very much like stories I read earlier in the book. \\n The chapters on their own contained a lot of action, but the overarching plotline progressed quite slowly.

It all may follow some functional system, but the system's negative imprints are really hard to spot. Especially since the system often goes unsaid. It's not that the book is hard to read or its descriptions hard to understand; we simply feel like Alice, thrown headfirst into things.

Once the protagonist opens up one can however, the story takes a new turn; and readers would have to go along with the author in believing that gathering evidence in a mysterious crime is coincidentally easy and readily available to curious children, to really appreciate the story.

His new father, Barney, is a junk dealer, and Louie's peers aren't too impressed. So Barney concocts a way to use the antiques he collects to open the door to an arena of adventure for Louie and his potential friends, an arena whose only limits are the confines of the universe, too vast and voluminous for all the human minds in history put together to fathom. If Louie and the other kids are willing to see Barney's weatherworn wares as he sees them, each one a makeshift craft to be buoyed by the winds of imagination and piloted to distant realms, then maybe the collective energy of all their imagination working together can be the starting point for lasting friendship. Whether visiting the moon or stars or exploring mysteries of far-off galaxies, a creative mind can do wonders for a group of kids playing in a junkyard, and it can do the same for us, wherever we may be. \\n Ezra Jack Keats's artistic style is distinctive, and the marriage of illustrations and storytelling clearly demonstrates why he was honored with Caldecott recognition on numerous occasions. Regards to the Man in the Moon isn't his most resounding work (for my money, that would be Maggie and the Pirate), but it's a solid early introduction to the power of creativity in connecting us to one another in spite of our differences, joining hands over divides of culture, class, economic station, and race. Ezra Jack Keats was a pioneer of promoting unity through his picture books, and Regards to the Man in the Moon continues that legacy. I would give it at least one and a half stars.\", 'Crenshaw is a cat. A really BIG cat. And the only one who can see him is Jackson.

Until Crenshaw showed up again when Jackson started fifth grade. Why did he show up now? And did that mean they were going to be homeless again? Or was Jackson going crazy? \\n This warmhearted and touching story of coping with loss and finding out what it means to be a family will bring tears of joy to all. Another winner from one of my favorite authors.', \"Reviewed for the Blast from the Past feature on my blog - Books by Proxy \\n 5 Stars \\n I remember my mum sitting on the edge of my bed, my hands clutching at the covers, as she told me the tale of Colin and Susan and their adventures with goblins and demon dogs, with warlocks, witches and wizards, and the forces for good and evil. I remember my heart beating faster, my eyes widening in anticipation, as the heroes started out on an adventure which was equal parts exciting, enthralling and terrifying. I was walking hand in hand with Colin and Susan to Alderley Edge; I was following them deeper underground, with the earth closing up around me and the forces of darkness at my heels. I was part of their adventure. For me, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen really did inspire a love of fantasy fiction which has lasted a lifetime. \\n Garner's first tale of Alderley is rooted in folklore and local mythology, and is ultimately about the battle between the powers of good and evil. The book follows the story of two children, Colin and Susan, a brother and sister who are deposited by unwitting parents at a family friend's house near Alderley Edge. Unknowingly, Susan has in her possession the Weirdstone - a magical jewel incorporated into a bracelet, and passed down to Susan as a family heirloom. This jewel holds the only magic which can defeat the evil spirit Nastrond. \\n When evil stirs, Colin and Susan must embark on a quest to return the Weirdstone to the wizard Cadellin, who guards an army of sleeping warriors in the dwarven caves of Fundindelve. Through tunnels and caves, forests and mountain; the children must outrun the creatures of evil who pursue them and keep the Weirdstone from falling into enemy hands. Their very lives depend on it. \\n As a child, living not far from Alderley, we made frequent visits to the Edge. I spent my childhood playing in the woods and standing on the sandstone ridge, staring out onto the plains and peaks beyond. We would become witches and sorcerers at the Wizard's Well and hunt for fairies in the Druid's Circle. We even made trips down the old mines which riddled the area - dark tunnels breaking out into huge, earthy caves; the red sandstone glittering with coppery green. Alderley Edge was a place of magic and adventure, and there is nothing quite like discovering that your fantasy world is real. That every bird you see above you is an enemy spy, and that deep underground, under the very earth you stand on, dwarven caves and mines host an army of sleeping warriors. This wasn't fiction - It was reality. \\n A few years later I was sat in a classroom, legs crossed on the floor with thirty other children, as my teacher told us the tale of the Weirdstone and how two young siblings, much like us, embarked on a journey to return it to where it belonged. After countless readings, I was delighted to find myself back in a world which, to me, epitomised adventure. I have gone back to Alan Garner's world of Alderley time and time again, and will in all likelihood continue to do so. I love The Weirdstone of Brisingamen as much now as I did then. And perhaps there's still something in me that sees the furtive looks between birds, and hears the rumblings from underground, and truly believes that the world of fantasy is closer than we think.\", 'Theme: Rainbows \\n Addition themes: imagination, rain', 'Pertama kali aku baca buku ini waktu SMP, buku pinjaman punya sahabat baikku Thia.

They find it particularly funny for some reason. I consider myself to be a relatively quiet person by nature, reserved (except where kids are concerned), so there must be something funny about me stepping out and letting my voice be heard. Now I\\'m not talking about my normal, voice-carries-through-a-crowd voice for storytimes, but extra special, super loud explosions. I tend to gravitate towards books that allow me to stretch my vocal chords and give the kids what they want (Mo Willems\\' pigeon books are especially good for this, as are some of his Elephant and Piggie books). The latest book to let me let loose is Kristen Balouch\\'s The Little Little Girl with the Big Big Voice. Naturally. \\n The Little Little Girl with the Big Big Voice is loud in every way. The little girl, with her comically large, bubblegum pink mouth is quite loud, so loud that she scares away large and fierce animals left and right. Until, that is, she came upon a lion, which opened his own rather large mouth, and let loose a terrible ROAR (this bit got roars of laughter from my audience). Luckily for us, the little girl is not only really, really loud, she is fearless to boot. She laughs at the lion\\'s roar, and together they go off and play the day away. \\n Loud, vibrant illustrations mark this simple story. The little girl, with her crazy black hair in pigtails, smiling brown face and striped dress, stands in contrast to bold backgrounds of green, orange and pink. Especially beautiful is the two page spread where our heroine first comes across the lion, with its colorful plants and flowers, the large, slumbering lion and the tiny ladybug hovering nearby. The text is spare and repetitive but gets the job done. Each time \"something scared the elephant/snake/crocodile away\" I\\'d raise my voice and get giggles from the crowd. This is a great storytime title, and one I\\'ll have a lot of fun putting into the hands of my young readers and listeners.', 'This is an audio collection of a few assorted Gaiman stories written for the kiddies. The stories were peopled with oddball characters and fantastical plots as is to be expected from Gaiman\\'s work. \\n \"Wolves In The Walls\" begins when a young girl begins to hear odd sounds emanating from within the walls. She\\'s eventually told by per parents the sounds are the wolves that live in the walls and if they get out \"it\\'s all over!\". They don\\'t seem too worried about it however as they carry on with their distracted lives. This is a wonderfully eerie little tale and it\\'s read perfect by Gaiman (as they all are). \\n \"Cinnamon\" is the story of a young princess who will not talk. Her vexed family promises great riches to anyone who can force her to speak. A very-sure-of-himself tiger arrives to do the job correctly. The ending of this one had me grinning. \\n \"The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish\" is a great story about another otherwise occupied parent. This time he gets traded away for two goldfish who interest his son much more than he does. Trouble arises when the boy realizes he\\'s in big trouble when mom returns home! \\n The final story is a poem called \"Crazy Hair\" which any kid who has ever moaned at having his/her hair brushed can relate to.

Author Fleming deftly deals with some darker issues, such as Kid's debilitating stranger anxiety, and the fact Will was orphaned as a baby when both his parents died when the Twin Towers fell. But the central themes are of friendship, love, acceptance, and courage in many different forms, and Fleming has created a sweet story that can be understood on several levels. While this is decidedly a children's book, I found it surprisingly appealing as an adult reader. Written by a Vancouver writer, I predict several Canadian accolades, and I would not be surprised by a Newbery nomination. Fingers crossed - this is an absolute delight for young and mature readers alike.\", 'I don\\'t know if I like it. I am reading the second one. I am mentally turning the characters into Sims to add to my game. But I don\\'t know if I \"like\" it. I so rarely read a book where I know everything is going to end up bad. Also I think I came into the book thinking Count Olaf was Dick Dastardly. That was Jim Carrey\\'s fault. Instead we have a villain who was so much more evil... Batman Rogues Gallery Evil. \\n The writing is very well done. I enjoy very much how Lemony Snicket spins his tale of unfortunate events. I am conflicted thou... do I like it?', \"I didn't like this book at all. The premise could have been interesting. A kid moves into a new house with a castle nearby, and the statues in that castle's garden come to life. The statues at first seem to follow her whims to at least some extent, and protect her from the jerk landlord she's forced to live with. But later, she begins to wonder if she really does have that much control over them. \\n Thing is, this is one of those stories where not much happens. I would have like to have seen far more things happen involving the castle and the statues, but they really don't *do* that much in the story. It's just a slow moving story in general. A great deal more is spent on the relationship between Dinah, her mom, and the landlord who Dinah's mom appears smitten with. The landlord doesn't like Dinah one bit, and she doesn't like him, and she's afraid he'll split apart the relationship between her and her mother. Dinah's statues help her keep the landlord at bay, but also scare away the two local boys who decide to try to become her friends because they find her fascinating. \\n A lot of time is spent describing home life and the way the two boys try to learn more about Dinah, who to them holds an air of mystery, but barely any time is spent on the things that I feel would have made the book more exciting, or interesting. I think if the writer reversed her priorities, I'd like this book a lot more. \\n I was really bored reading this book through to the end. It's slow, the dramatic writing style doesn't appeal to me, I found the characters bland, and I could not enjoy it one bit. Just a huge disappointment.\", \"This book is about two young sisters who sneak out and join in a civil rights rally and march led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The author and illustrator's notes at the beginning are helpful and it's made clear this book was created to honor the young people that contributed to the civil rights movement. The prose is lovely and the story is moving but rather slight. \\n The illustrations are truly special. They could be considered black and white; they're all in grays and browns (even the blue portions of the American flag) except for the red that's in the roses, the American flag, and the ribbon around the neck of the younger sister's teddy bear. \\n I don't think kids would understand what's going on in the story unless they knew at least a little bit about the civil right's movement of the 1950s-1960s. But, if it's not their first book on this subject, it's a wonderful way to communicate the concept that children can participate in making history and can make valuable contributions.\", \"Couldn't stop laughing!

Common themes run through each profile - a large picture of the child wearing typical clothing, a quick introduction to the child's family and living arrangements, how the child signs their name, what they eat, what school is like, etc. Each page is covered with plenty of photos. \\n One criticism I have is skewed selection of kids. Of the 35 kids representing the whole world - 5 are from the US. The authors tried hard to select a variety of different US citizens (an Acoma Indian from New Mexico, a suburbanite from LA, a city-dweller from New York, a small town resident from Illinois, and a Yu'pik Eskimo from Alaska), but nevertheless I think that 4 of these could easily have been used to profile kids from 4 additional countries. These 4 could have represented a Pacific Island (maybe Vanuatu, Fiji or Samoa), South-West Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, or Tajikistan), Central Africa (eg Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, etc) and Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, etc).

There were only a few moments where I was pulled into the scene enough to imagine anything. Other than that it felt like a list of thoughts the character was having while trapped in the well. Also, I tend to like creepier or darker tales as this book was advertised in journal reviews, but this book wasn't as creepy or as scary as I had hoped.

Each time I read Narwhal: unicorn of the sea! I find myself grinning from ear to ear. \\n Narwhal certainly doesn\\'t lack self-confidence. He considers himself to be \"really awesome,\" and quite frankly, who doesn\\'t think narwhals are awesome! Narwhal is rather clueless about things other than himself though, so when he meets Jelly, the jellyfish, they have a funny conversation about whether or not each other are real. Jelly has never seen a narwhal before, and Narwhal thinks that Jelly certainly looks like jelly, but not so much like a fish, so he\\'s not sure jellyfish are real either. In the end, Narwhal suggest they become imaginary friends and they both discover a love for waffles. \\n Ben Clanton\\'s illustrations are relatively simple, but they still manage to portray emotion and action. The book is formatted almost like a cross between a graphic novel, with some pages containing sequential panel illustrations, and a picture book, with full page scenes. Narwhal and Jelly will be a series of books. Each book contains five different short story chapters. Overall, these are great books for readers who are graduating from Elephant & Piggie picture books and have the stamina for a longer graphic novel story. \\n The different stories in each book focus on friendship and fun. Narwhal seems mostly concerned with himself, but we learn that he is also a little clueless about relationships, so it is good that Jelly is around to balance out his harmless airhead personality. \\n Certain threads run throughout the books in the series. The two characters share a love for waffles and invent stories that feature a kung fu waffle and his strawberry sidekick. Each book also contains a chapter that presents interesting facts about sea creatures. The themes of friendship and inclusion make the Narwhal and Jelly stories truly special. \\n I highly recommend Narwhal and Jelly -- they make readers smile and leave you feeling warm and happy.', \"it was a very curious but nice book. that's all.\", \"Zader's odyssey continues. \\n Zadar is a Hawaiian boy allergic to water.

The illustrations are absolutely fantastic and I particularly love the way that aspects of contemporary life, such as two lads discussing something on the iPad with grandma, a lady taking a selfie at a light display and dad trying to fly his new remote control helicopter are all present, but peripheral to the main events. The best bit about this book for me however was the fact that the illustrator has obviously paid close attention to inclusion and representation in creating the characters. Although the protagonist family are fair, white (and slightly sweaty!) Australians, every scene that depicts other people includes characters who possess a range of skin tones. Just at a quick glance it is possible to spot an Indian couple, a number of Asian families, a Maori family and a family that, judging by their outfits, may be from West Africa. There\\'s even an Inuit family friend who for some reason has chosen to wear traditional cold-weather clothing. Representation aside, there\\'s plenty going on in each illustrative spread for keen eyed mini-fleshlings to spot. \\n This is a story that seems simple at first glance, but has more layers to uncover every time you look through it. The illustrations, obviously, have much to do with this. The most memorable page for me is one that notes that on Christmas day, \"every place is bursting\". The pages feature a number of different social groupings, mostly showing families, but also with a few touching asides. I will admit to getting a little stab in the heart as I noted that one of the pictures shows an old lady dressed in a jaunty Christmas bonbon hat, putting food out on Christmas themed paper plates for about half a dozen cats. While the lady herself looks perfectly happy (and there\\'s no indication that she hasn\\'t just popped out from family festivities for a moment), I felt like this was a little reminder that others may not be celebrating with a large, jolly social group. Whatever the case, as well as providing a cheerful Christmas read-aloud for the mini-fleshlings, there are also other aspects of the book that will no doubt start conversations about diversity and how others do things. \\n Recommended. Especially for those in a cold climate, who no doubt won\\'t be thinking of us southerners at all as we sweat it out over our Christmassy summer.', \"mn 'fDl w'jwd lktb lty qr'th `n trby@ l'Tfl, bl `d@ fSwl fy lktb hy nqT tTwyr wt`lym llkbr qbl lSGr \\n mhm lkl 'b w'm wmrby wm`lm\", 'Beautiful, beautiful book about the life and times of a porcelain rabbit who learned to love and be loved.

I enjoyed this one, but it dragged a little compared to his others. It's unfair to compare As Brave As You to Reynold's other children's book from 2016 (Ghost) - they are two completely different stories that require two different paces (a story about kids running track will naturally be a little more fast-paced than a story of two brothers picking peas every morning). The day-by-day acclimation of Brooklynites Genie and Ernie to their grandparent's small-town southern living was interesting to follow, I just wonder how many kids will lose interest (as I almost did). But when it comes to characterization, Reynolds still showed his mastery. Genie was the star, and his innocently hilarious/poignant question notebook made me love him a whole lot. His admiration for his older brother Ernie, and Ernie's obvious love for Genie, was also a shining part of the book for me. \\n Side note: This was one of my favorite book covers of 2016.\", 'Can you imagine me not touching every page in this book.

She provides middle-grade readers a story with well-developed characters, a plot that's full of surprises, and strong friendships. \\n Lorelei has dealt with a lot the past year: the death of her mother, her father's remarriage to her evil stepmother Molly, and now her school has burnt down. But just before she's forced to hike all the way across town each morning, Splendid Academy opens right down the street. This school has everything a kid could want from the ultimate playground to candy bowls at your desk to virtually no rules! But is this academy as sweet as it seems? Lorelei adores Principal Trapp. She's beautiful, nice, and seems to understand Molly in a way that few others can. Her teacher, Ms. Morrigan, however, is a complete witch that gives Molly the creeps from the get go. So when Andrew, the class outcast, shows Lorelei some disturbing behavior the school brings out in their classmates, the pair team up to save their peers and form a heart-warming friendship. \\n Loftin has created a story with well-defined characters that have quirky characteristics. Children who fit into the middle-grade age group are just beginning to come into their own and tend to butt heads with authority a bit, so they will likely empathize with Lorelei's problems with the adults in her life. In Splendid, most of the adults are evil or just can't help her. Her teacher, Ms. Morrigan, and the new music teacher definitely have mean streaks. Lorelei's new stepmother, Molly, is having a difficult time balancing the responsibilities of being a mom with what she wants. Loftin sets her up so that I was constantly wondering if she is eviler than she seems. And, even Lorelei' dad is unable to help her. Still recovering from the death of his wife and trying to help Molly and the children come to terms with one another, Dad is having trouble coping with less-immediate-but-still-important problems in their lives, like Lorelei's writing issues or her problems with her teachers. He has a tendency to be dismissive of his daughter's concerns, not out of a lack of concern but just out of an inability to deal. \\n Even though Splendid is based on a fairy tale, it tackles real issues that children face: obesity, peer pressure, bullying, and dysplasia, to name a few. Many of the characteristics that are considered negative in our culture work out to be a plus for the kids at Splendid Academy. For example, if Andrew did not have weight issues, he would never have noticed the other students' weird reaction to the school. Or, if there wasn't bullying on the playground, its curious ingredient would never have been uncovered. \\n Nikki Loftin has written a fantastic present-day spin on a treasured fairy tale. The Sinister Sweetness of Splendid Academy was a quick read that drew me in and kept me guessing throughout the story.\", 'Loved It!!!! \\n Full Review: http://louiseereads.blogspot.com.au/2... \\n 5 Stars!', 'It took me a while to get through this book, but I did like the ending. I would recommend to mature readers as (spoiler alert) the mom gets diagnosed with breast cancer, and it may generate conversations.

While he had difficulties in speaking in class and around large groups of people, Alan could easily communicate with small groups of people and with animals. Thus his bond with and love for animals was born. As he grows up, Alan learns to both conquer and embrace the fact that he will always be a stutterer, and he soon becomes an advocate for animals. \\n I really liked how the illustrations were a bit understated and more emphasis was given to the expressive faces that spoke more than the actual text. I also liked how the illustrator played around the sizes of the various characters of the book. For example, Alan is shown as this small boy who can easily be overlooked when he has to speak up in class and as his confidence grows so does he. The animals have a mystical and mysterious quality to them as Alan gazes into their eyes and \"speaks\" to them.

In their first \"case\" they are determined to track down the person behind a spate of counterfeit coins doing the rounds in Lambeth. Thunderbolt\\'s dad has been arrested but they are sure it couldn\\'t be him who was making the coins - can they find a way to prove it and have him released from prison? \\n The Gas-Fitters\\' Ball continues the adventures of the New Cut gang, this time they are on the hunt for a burglar - someone has stolen the Gas-Fitters\\' silver trophies and the gang are intent on finding out who. Can they beat the police to find the burglar? \\n I absolutely loved the characters that make up the New Cut gang. You have leader Benny who has an imagination that often runs away with him and comes up with crazy plans bound to get them all in trouble, then there is Sam (AKA Thunderbolt) - he is the smart and studious one, Bridie is the hot tempered red head with a heart of gold who is always looking out for the others and her little brother Sharkie Bob who was probably my favourite. A lot younger than the others he tags along wherever they go eating everything in sight. You can\\'t forget the Peretti twins Angela and Zerlina who may look like angels but you wouldn\\'t want to end up on their bad side. \\n The stories themselves are fun and lighthearted adventures that had me laughing out loud as I read them.

His books have been an essential part of my existence. So time and again, I go back to him and relive the time of being a child again. \\n The Blue Umbrella , is one of the short stories penned by him, which speak of greed, happiness, infatuation, and sharing in the most innocent way possible. The story revolves around a blue umbrella, which can be termed as the normal hue of the blue sky. But it is what attracts our little protagonist- Bindya towards it. So much for its beauty that she traded her lucky Tiger claw pendant for it. The trade off also involves a little banter between the lady who owns it and her husband. Reading that dialogue what all you can think of is how we humans take everything for granted and believe we can own the world at our own will. \\n What ensues afterward is the love of a little girl with her umbrella, that last the sun, the rains and now the snow. This love is being envied by all- the young and old of the town. Those people engage \\n Bindya and even her elder brother, Bijju in highly amazing trade off. But Bindya pays heed to none and marches off with her little blue umbrella. \\n This has annoyed many people in the tiny village. Be it the trustworthy Ram Bharosa tea stall owner or the headmaster's wife. So much has the obsession that the priest travels to the nearby town of Tehri and only come dejected home that the umbrella is available only in Delhi. \\n What as a reader will shock you the human psychology explained by Ruskin Bond in the easiest way possible. Ram Bharosa is later shown to be just thinking of the blue umbrella, though it does not serve many purposes to him. It is this infatuation that he agrees with his servant to steal the umbrella. \\n His servant is nearly successful in stealing it. But Bindya ousts him in the battle along with some help from Bijju. Then comes the realization part where villagers banish Ram Bharosa and he lives a life of isolation for months to follow on. What will intrigue the readers is the innocence of Bindya that she finds herself responsible for Ram Bharosa's condition even though he, as an adult thought of stealing it. She finds her love for the umbrella overwhelming that she enters Ram Bharosa shop and buys toffees, leaves the umbrella there. \\n Ram Bharosa initially planning to hide it, too has a change of heart and runs towards Bindiya to return it. The conversation between the two will strike a lightning rod in your heart and later on the deed of Ram Bharosa gifting Bindiya a silver coated Bear claw will make you believe all over again: \\n A good deed is a good deed that shines in a weary world. \\n Apologies to my readers for writing nearly half of the story. But my writing is nowhere near to the prime of Ruskin Bond. Just do read it once, will cost you only 15 minutes of your life while you rush to board that last metro to work or home.

The intermittent chapters of the transcript for the Senate Committee investigating the events in the story clearly illustrate what has happened, with scientists explaining concepts like biofuel production and genetic mutation (and offer a great jumping off point for introducing these concepts and debate around the dangers of tampering with nature). \\n Many thanks to Random House for the advance reading copy.\", 'Would be nice to pair with Radiant Child which is a story about the artist of the pictures of the book.

They climbed aboard his shell and Turtle supplied them with fish to eat. Happily, Owl could knit, Bear could build, Frog could cook, and Cat could draw. The four quickly went to work and created a home aboard Turtle. Turtle wasn't lonely any more. One might think the book would end there, but instead the four smaller animals got very homesick and missed their families. They had to return home, leaving Turtle all alone in the big ocean again. What is a big lonely turtle to do, especially now that he realizes the importance of having good friends? \\n Sherry has a way with simple storytelling. He manages to convey complicated emotions using a combination of his storyline and his illustrations. Here the impact of having friends is looked at with humor and through a unique relationship of a huge turtle and characters riding on his back. It's a very nice metaphor for needing to support friends in different ways. \\n As with all of Sherry's books, his cartoony illustrations are child friendly and add to the humor. They keep this story from becoming overly sweet, showing goggle-eyed animals in different colors and always clearly showing that Turtle is simply huge. \\n Gently funny, simple and honest, this picture book is a friend to any story time on friendship or turtles.

Told from all four points of view (always in third person) we see the story unfold in a fairly unique way. I really appreciated the third person narration. So many stories that are written from different view points are told in first person without enough difference in the voice of the character to distinguish who\\'s turn it is to tell their story.

She ignores a boy asking for food, and ignores an old woman\\'s advice not to laugh at some laughing trees and to be polite to an old man carrying his head under his arm. When she reaches the King early, she sees a horrible serpentine monster. Nyasha, on the other hand, gets up in the morning, gives the little boy her lunch, gives the old woman some sunflower seeds, and upon seeing the King, only sees the little snake Nyoka who had befriended her in her garden back home. Nyoka transforms into a human King, who reveals that he was the little boy and the old woman and wants Nyasha to be his wife. Of course, she consents, and Manyara becomes a servant in the palace. \\n There were elements in this that were similar to The Talking Eggs, like the instructions not to laugh and the presence of a person with a removable head. I would guess that The Talking Eggs is a later Americanized version of the story with its roots in this one and possibly something even older. \\n It also seems to me that the definition among writers of what makes a \"Cinderella story\" is pretty loose. The common elements don\\'t seem to be much more than a nasty sister or two and a good sister who is rewarded for her righteousness by either marrying royalty or acquiring wealth. I wonder if all of these stories from different cultures actually share common roots, or if they are just variations that have evolved independently on a very human theme. It does make me suspicious, though, that the author of this one says he got the tale from an 1895 book. Many of the European fairy tales are at least a couple of hundred years older than that, so I\\'m wondering if the Cinderella variations we\\'re reading in my children\\'s lit class ultimately do come from an Italian source, from which modern authors have borrowed and inserted elements into other cultures\\' traditional folktales.', 'I\\'m not particularly fond of Beverly Cleary\\'s style of writing.

Then again, all of Montgomery's work is now marketed for YAs or children, even the books that were clearly aimed at grown-ups when she wrote them (Kilmenny of the Orchard or A Tangled Web come to mind.)

Four family members in a painting on their wall, but only three in the house; the little boy in the painting appears in another painting, solo, in his sister's room. And then you see the empty chair. \\n The story has such a moving message about grieving and healing and helping. It shows kids, in a non-ham-fisted way, that when you help others, you also help yourself. It's lovely.

I read this book exactly when I needed to, during one of the moments in my life when I\\'ve felt the most homesick, especially because I miss the mountains, just like Heidi. It also contains the best representations of depression I\\'ve ever read about. Johanna Spyri definitely \"gets it\". \\n Heidi and I share those two issues, homesickness and depression. However, the only aspect of this book I didn\\'t love is how every problem, including these, solves itself by \"waiting it out\" and/or praying to God for it to be solved. That culturally-instilled logic has been a constant letdown throughout my entire life, especially because of its ubiquity amongst adults and media who kept reinforcing it despite the fact that creating idealistic expectations only aggravates the problems because consistently, the reality doesn\\'t match the expectation. That logic didn\\'t get me anywhere as a kid, and it is an irresponsible farce that has taken me way too long to weed out from my psyche as an adult. Sure, we love it when problems solve themselves BUT IT OBVIOUSLY DOESN\\'T JUST ALWAYS WORK LIKE THAT. Anyway, I love this book so much that I wanted to share it with my little niece and nephew when they\\'re older, but just those bits of the book make me very reluctant to do so. \\n Isn\\'t it ironic that I found this book exactly when I needed to though?

Also, she takes the bookmobile for a ride, tells a story at a bookstore story time, and meets the head librarian. \\n I liked the setting of the book, but some of the puns are a little bit obtuse compared to the ones I remembered from growing up.

Augie, like Alex Libby, is an amazing person with fascinating interests, incredible courage, a wickede sense of humor, loving compassion for others, a willingness to forgive other people\\'s weaknesses and bad behavior, and he can be a lot of fun to be around if you take the time to get past the surface. Augie, though, unlike Alex, has such severe deformities that it takes a lot more work to get past his surface. The story takes you all the way through his first full year at school. One minute you\\'ll be laughing out loud about something that happens and the next minute you\\'ll be crying. A minute later you\\'ll be incredibly angry. The author takes you on a roller coaster of emotions without being heavy handed. \\n Fans of The Neverending Story know that a good book can make you feel like you are the main character. As Augie, you fearfully wonder if anyone will let you sit near them in the lunchroom. You feel betrayed when your best friend says something terrible about you behind your back. You fret that your own sister doesn\\'t want you to come to her school play because she\\'s tired of the spotlight always being on you. Within just a few paragraphs you ARE Augie. \\n Then, R.J. Palacio shakes things up. Suddenly you start to experience being other people in Augie\\'s life: his best friend, his sister, her friend, six other characters in all. This is critically important. Told differently this story could have made you feel very sorry for Augie and furious at the other characters, but you might not see yourself in the circle of people around him. Without getting into the other characters\\' skin and seeing things through THEIR eyes you might unwittingly continue be part of the problem of bullying instead of being part of the solution. With Wonder, you get to see how one little thing that you do can cause unbelievable pain, or how another tiny simple thing can bring great joy. \\n That was also a message clearly learned by the people who had seen Bully. Every single person in the room had either been bullied or had witnessed another person being bullied. Some admitted to having engaged in bullying against others. Over half, though, despite being witnesses to bullying, had never taken action to stop someone from bullying. Virtually everyone in the room pledged to become \"upstanders instead of bystanders.\" \\n Wonder brings that message home more clearly than any other novel I have read about bullying. One criticism I\\'ve seen about the book (spoiler alert) is that it has a happy ending. We know that many bullying stories end in tragedy. One of my greatest coming out gripes was that just about every book about growing up gay ended with the gay person getting beaten up, murdered, or committing suicide. Yes, that can and does happen, but it doesn\\'t have to. My hope is that someone who reads this book will realize that one simple act of kindness, one moment of being a little extra mindful, simply looking at someone long enough to catch their eye and then smiling (which prevented one contemplated suicide that I know of) or giving someone an awkward little wave, or letting an adult know that a child is in terrible pain, could mean the difference between life and death. \\n Augie\\'s fictional story has a happy ending. Alex Libby is really happy with his life now that he has moved to a new home and new school and has been warmly accepted by the people in his new town. Any child can make the difference between happy endings and heartbreaks. Wonder empowers children to make that difference. Simply taking a seat in the lunchroom next to another kid who looks all alone can be a huge gift (and you may find that your next year of lunches are much more fun than they would have been at some other table). We each have the power to transform someone else\\'s world, and at the same time, our own. Sometimes that transformation starts when someone hands you a book and says \"you\\'ve got to read this.\" \\n Wonder is among the best books I\\'ve ever read and I hope that it becomes even more widely read by children than the Harry Potter series. Real children can\\'t ride a broomstick and win the Tri-Wizard Cup, but they can do amazing magic to keep other children safe and happy. \\n Now..... to read more about how this book and Alex Libby (from the film Bully) merge together, visit our web site at: \\n http://www.reachandteach.com/s/wonder', \"Loved this book as a kid; recently picked up the Annotated Edition and can't wait to re-read once more with footnotes.

Parents will immediately see that this book is about children being potty trained, but children may be too caught up in the monster humor to feel any pressure themselves. \\n The tone here is just right, allowing children to laugh about learning to use the potty. The humor is physical, potty humor that all children will hoot about. The unexpected twists and turns in potty training are showed to monstrous proportions and great effect. Moon's illustrations bring to life a bright-colored menagerie of monsters with silly befitting names.

A major theme running through the story is that of union workers and their rights. Blacks and other minorities were kept out of unions. When her dad takes Cassie, the protagonist, to see the new union building she declares that she will get that building for him by flying over it. She imagines how things might be different if she could do this for him and about all the other things she will take possession of with her ability to fly. These fantasy elements may be lost of younger children. Like many Caldecott (and other) honor books, the messages seem more suited for the parents reading them aloud to their children than the children themselves.\", 'Good book for upper primary students. Looks at bullying and being the new student at school (as well as new to Australia). Struggling with Australian slang was rather funny, but you can see how difficult it can be for a new comer.', \"A hilarious little book! Roald Dahl's twists on popular fairy tales told in rhymes had me in fits of laughter. I enjoyed all the stories and thought it was wonderful how the stories got funnier as the book progressed with the ending of the final story being a brilliant conclusion. Highly recommended.\", \"This is a remake of an early 20th century German book, so there's plenty of twee there-- which was ok since I don't mind twee. Audrey Wood's baroque illustrations were a fun read for me, and there's definitely a nature-god subtext going on there. My six year old son was uninterested. I'd pair it with the Lynne Plourde seasons books (Spring's Sprung etc.)\", \"Adorable. I really, really liked this. It's like an odd cross between Wind in the Willows and Dr. Seuss. There are shallow characters, kind characters, vain characters, selfless characters, and characters with questionable morals all wrapped up in this funny little family who will accept anyone who seems to need a family. It sort of wanders about telling bits of tales that make up a lovely summer in the Valley of the Moomins. There's never any real sense of alarm, even when the Groke shows up, because everyone can be reasoned with or, at the very least least, bought. And where one person finds their limits, another steps in to help. It's adorable. I love it.\", 'This is a fun book for emerging readers. There are three stories about two friends: \"Meet My Friend\" in which they play a strange and silly version of Tag, \"Snail\\'s Adventure\" in which Snail attempts to climb a tall flower, and \"Meet My Pet\" in which we meet a couple of unlikely pets for Snail and Worm. This book kind of reminds me of the Frog and Toad books by Arnold Lobel. According to the title page, \"Tina used acrylic on pastel paper, collage, and digital media to create the illustrations. No snails or worms were harmed in the making of this book.\"', \"Being a fifth grade boy means being thwarted at every turn. Cheesie and his friend Georgie have the BEST ideas for summer, but keep getting shot down. They can't pull their awesome pranks at fifth grade graduation. Then, Georgie can't go to summer camp because his father loses his job. When the boys find an envelope from the 1950s in the basement, they try to locate the owner to return the penny and necklace within it, but are stopped by a policeman who thinks they are just fooling around. The boys persevere, and things end well, but not after a lot of high jinks. \\n Strengths: Funny, with enough action to satisfy the target audience. Interesting bits of information thrown in for the die-hard nonfiction readers who are being forced to read a chapter book. I believe Mr. Cotler that he still can think like an eleven-year-old. This will be popular. \\n Weaknesses: Just a tiny bit too young for my students. I'm getting nose wrinkles from the Time Warp Trio books, which I still think are great, and the same illustrator provided the fine illustrations for this book, which elementary students will adore.\", \"Did you know there was once a Boarding School for Cats?

Mary Stolz\\' classic book forces the reader to do just that by telling the story of a frustrated boy named Martin Hastings. Beneath the gruff, thoughtless exterior is a chubby boy who\\'s actually a little bit lonely himself. Acting out is a way for him to get attention, and inevitably Martin comes into conflict with his next-door neighbor, Edward Frost. This book is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to put yourself in someone else\\'s shoes, albeit someone that you might not necessarily like...at least not at first! \\n One great thing about \"The Bully of Barkham Street\" is that it\\'s actually a companion novel to another book called \"A Dog on Barkham Street\". This book was published a few years earlier, and it tells the same events through Edward Frost\\'s point of view. I\\'d recommend reading both books, but no matter which you read first you\\'ll be able to see the conflict from both boys\\' points of view. Apparently, boys will be boys no matter the decade. If you\\'re looking for some great insight into the way boys think, look no further than the Barkham Street books!', \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader strikes me as the most melancholy of the Narnia books I've read so far; it benefits from being the one book in the series without a clear villain and is simply a picaresque voyage to the end of the world (aka Aslan's country). \\n Like Edmund in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, newcomer to Narnia Eustace Scrubb \\n undergoes a change of character as the narrative proceeds. Most of the book takes place aboard the ship the Dawn Treader, led by Prince Caspian, who's attempting to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia (see the book, Prince Caspian). The islands explored and adventures undertaken are by turns disturbing, exciting and amusing. A standout is Lucy Pevensie's creepy journey through the upstairs quarters of a magician named Coriakin. \\n The novel culminates in a remarkably metaphysical setting, as the Dawn Treader can literally go no further into the end of the world and Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep journey on into the strange, dreamlike, lilly-filled water in a small boat. One could argue that Aslan's country is as much a metaphor for mortality as heaven and Reepicheep's mysterious fate brings a poignancy to bear that most children's novels don't attempt.\", '\"Sheep are in.\" #priceless', \"Maria Teresa Maia Gonzalez is one of my fave YA writers. This is a book for teenagers and about their problems, but I've enjoyed reading it :)\", \"I may be wrong, but I thought the intention behind this book is to encourage children to read books with no pictures. However, it's written as a read-a-loud book for a parent/reader to read to the child... so how is that going to encourage a child to read a book without pictures, when the child isn't at the self-reading stage to begin with? \\n Confusing. \\n If I am wrong, and this book proves to have fantastic psyocological effect on children, then that's great. \\n Strictly as a read-aloud, it is engaging and fun and I think kids would love it.\", 'A quiet city in black and white bursts into color as an energetic child uses colorful crayons to create vibrant monsters that run rampant in this wordless picture book.

Sometimes a reader just needs a break from dark themes or long, prose-heavy works, or, simply, the present reality of life. At times like these, the only logical thing to do is pick up a classic (or contemporary) middle-grade or children\\'s book and get swept into its comforting story, like sipping a marshmallow-laden hot chocolate and wrapping a deliciously warm, wool blanket around yourself. But don\\'t let the word \"children\" fool you -- children\\'s literature touches on universal themes, delving into the joys and throes of human character in an extraordinarily entertaining (albeit shorter) way. Darkly amusing, terrifying, fun, mysterious, curious, or downright delightful, middle grade/kids lit is my antidote for a variety of ailments: sadness, depression, frustration, adult-ness, boredom, the overstressed, the overworked, and more. Though there are less pages and a smaller story, there is always a bigger picture. Less is more, and sentences of alarming alacrity hit you head-on, full-throttle. Children\\'s Lit is short, small, and packed. with. punch. \\n And M. P Kozlowsky\\'s JUNIPER BERRY doesn\\'t disappoint -- it is a fantastic read. The synposis: Juniper Berry\\'s parents, world-renowned actors/famous celebrities have \"not been right lately\". In fact, they have been cold, disinterested and cruel. Obsessed with greedily augmenting their current success, their actions and responses to Juniper become frightening. Her mother calls her \"useless\" at one point, and begs to know what people are saying about her online. \\n \"Juniper, dear, you go to all these websites, these gossip pages, posting boards. Have they been mentioning me? Where am I going? Where have I been?\" \\n All in all, their behaviour has been shockingly uncharacteristic. Juniper is lonely, sad, and neglected; constantly exploring the woods, she admits that discovery and exploration are her salvation. Juniper and her friend, Giles (whose famous parents also seem to be afflicted with the mean bug), are determined to figure out what is going on. One cold and rainy night, Juniper follows her parents as they sneak out of the house and enter the woods. She and Giles discover a world beneath a mysterious tree, a world which promises all their secret, personal desires -- at the price of their souls. \\n The evil, menacing, and manipulative...thing that rules this other world is eerily enticing, ensuring the children that \"there are far easier ways to get to the same places\" than hard work. Her parents, and Giles, have fallen into the trap, and the two have to have to save them -- but first, decide what the value of their souls are. \\n Kozlowsky touches on the pathetic nature of celebrity culture, describing the parents\\' fans akin to mindless, screeching crows lauding over food scraps, and the parents\\' behaviour as terrifyingly self-absorbed. He makes a parody of today\\'s technology and our fickle fascination with computers and cell phones, portraying it as futile and mind-numbing. And he makes important points about morals, happiness and life throughout -- points that are clearly and acutely felt, without feeling preachy. \\n Finally, the ARTWORK by Erwin Madrid is superb, creepily gorgeous, and haunting. Black and white, long, thin lines, curvy details, and deep shadows combine to give the book just the right flavour of mystery and fun. It\\'s a wonderful, frightening, and meaningful story, and I urge you all to give it a read! \\n Some poignant quotes: \\n \"When this theme park ride is over, we\\'re going to walk out the same doors we walked in. There was no miracle.\" \\n \"The imagination of the young is nothing to be dismissed.\" \\n \"I have yet to meet a person happy with what they are given.\" \\n \"The only truth is the one we create. It\\'s the rest that is a dream.\"', \"While this is a lovely read, it has some serious Santa spoilers! So while it's a beautiful children's story with beautiful illustrations, it's not really appropriate for children. An illustrated children's book for adults? . . .\", 'A wonderful retelling of a classic story. Though the artwork was a bit hard to see on my Kindle, it was still a very pleasurable read.

When he is supposed to go to his sister's martial arts competition, he instead gets dropped off at his archnemesis' house for the weekend, but when he can no longer stand the bullying, he starts for home, only to be intercepted by the Air Force! They take him and 11 other kids who all play this game and train them to fly the planes for real, because one has been stolen. Neil gets to meet several of the people he knows online, including the person he likes best, Sam... who turns out to be a girl. Soon, the kids find themselves on a remote island with Jones, an air force officer, in the middle of big trouble. A mad millionaire, Harris, has stolen the plane in an attempt to buy all of the video games in the world do that the ostrich based game he created, Feather Duster, will be the only one that people play. Helped out by quirky locals, Neil and his entourage try to use their video gaming skills to save the day. \\n Strengths: Video gaming AND military derring-do-- good stuff to start a book with. This is not very long, has a decent cover, and enough action and adventure to keep students reading. \\n Weaknesses: Not only is Neil bullied at home, there is also a bully in the Nerdy Dozen. That was a bit much. This also gets very, very quirky, which is too bad. The target demographic for this kind of book takes their gaming and military action very seriously, even in the 6th grade, so the quirkiness makes this seem like it is for younger students. I will still probably buy this for my library.\", 'All of a Kind Family is just so amazing! Such a sweet story of a Jewish family living in the early 1900s. So sweet and innocent.

I\\'m not an expert, but in my head because I write and read a LOT, I get to make up my own worlds, and they\\'re always better/perfect, and everything goes exactly the way it is \\'supposed\\' to. \\n Books are evil the most fantastic thing ever invented/created, and give me ideas. Ideas that my world could be a better place - could look totally different, and could really be the peaceful urban oasis in the center of North America (not quite) but almost. \\n I\\'m pretty sure Rugby ND is also a null-void (and they also sort-of missed the mark). I say this lovingly. Or as lovingly as I can say that. Maybe it\\'s simply that geographically we\\'re all in a sort of low spot. Or the banks of former Lake Aggasi. My made up worlds happen either far in the future, or far in the past, but everyone of them turns this land I live in, into a summery paradise with forests and dragons and unknown adventures galore. \\n Lake Agassiz: Manitoba land/lake scape 30,000 to 10,000 years ago \\n What the heck does that have to do with a Persnickety Princess, dragons and some hilariously named characters? \\n EVERYTHING. \\n I\\'m not a kid anymore, and I\\'m not in middle grade either, but on a day like today (with 20 more cm of snow-read 1.5 feet) The Persnickety Princess is exactly the book you need to read. \\n Why? Oh you can guess I\\'m going to tell you why - but I bet you can\\'t guess how. \\n I\\'m going to tell you my own story. . . \\n First - let\\'s get through the important stuff. The characters in this book are so awesomely named like \\'Upon A. Time\\' and Big and Not Big. It\\'s exactly the kind of language play kids in middle school get. \\n How do I know that? I teach piano. Every child I teach has their own specific made up language and way of communicating with their friends and as a teacher I somehow find myself stuck between the worlds of friends and parents/authority figures. \\n All you have to do to figure out how Falcon Storm has accomplished this is read his biography at the end of this post. It\\'s the one thing to have the worlds made up in your head, and another thing entirely to put them down on paper and hope the crazy police don\\'t search you out and lock you up. \\n This book is also the perfect length for reading with your child on a cold, snowy or rainy day, and one that they can easily enjoy themselves even if it takes them a little longer to read it on their own. The world from Falcon Storm\\'s imagination is gorgeous and colorful, and full of descriptors that every kid will latch onto, and probably start calling people by new names like \\'Big and Not-Big\\' or \\'This and That\\'. As a teacher, language play is so important, and trying to teach someone the language of music is much like trying to get inside the magical fairy lands that exist in every kids head. I LOVE Alice in Wonderland - and this is the first chapter book I\\'ve read that I would EVER make that comparison to and be comfortable saying - \\'If you kid enjoyed Alice, then you need to get a copy of The Persnickety Princess - ASAP.\\' \\n This book - actually helped me to remember and understand that once just how differently and imaginatively kids brains work. When one of my students gave me what I thought was the wrong answer to a music question I took a step back, and then figured out that they were RIGHT! She wasn\\'t using conventional rhythm names, but she was right - just speaking in a different language. \\n I felt a special connection to Natalie the Not-So-Nasty witch, as I have my own familiar, but I would NEVER paint him black. He\\'s getting old, and perhaps one day soon will be come my familiar ghost. Until then though, he\\'ll sleep on his electric blanket and get all the love he requires from humans. I also loved the Bard Upon A. Time, and the teaser at the end which will definitely give me more of Natalie\\'s story - the one thing I wanted more of in the book. \\n P.S. I totally respect that it needs to be in a different book, but seriously - I want to read about Natalie NOW. \\n I want it NOW like I want it to be May and there to be new Star Trek \\n So, \"NOW, NOW, NOW\" and yes, I\\'m being totally Persnickety about it. \\n Why else did I love this book? \\n To keep this as short as possible, and as canny as I can and still do the author justice - we have to talk about the world of Persnickety. I made that Star Trek reference for two reasons. \\n 1. Both the world of Star Trek and the world of Persnickety are complex. Reading through the Princess\\'s tale makes me think of being on a far off planet full of robust colors, imaginative creatures and real people with real problems. \\n 2. Both of them are incredibly colorful. Each one, the book and the awesome TV series (plural) had gloriously colored, incredibly beautiful, wildly colorful characters and landscapes. \\n Just LOOK at the cover - and then take a second to make the connection that an artist came up with that cover for a book, based on Falcon Storm\\'s writing. \\n Yes, It\\'s that good \\n 3. (Oops, there are more reasons.) Princess Lavender\\'s problems may be of her own making, but that\\'s what makes a good character - human flaws, and all the crazy antics we go to to get what we want.

You get the idea. \\n About the Book, the Author and Pie and also Prizes! \\n About the book \\n High up in the tallest tower of the purplest castle in the Kingdom by the Sea, Princess Lavender awaits rescue. Desperate as she may be, only the most dashing, well dressed, properly mannered prince will do. Oh, and he must stand exactly four and three-quarters inches taller than her. A princess has got to have standards, after all. \\n When, finally, one such prince comes to her castle--not to rescue her, but her younger sister--Lavender refuses to be ignored. Instead of waiting for the next suitor to come along, she devises a plan to put herself in danger, thus forcing the upstart prince to forget her sister and rescue her instead. \\n Well accustomed to getting her way, there is only one thing, unfortunately, that this princess can\\'t control--her luck. When her plans go awry, putting her in very real danger, will she allow the prince to rescue her as he sees fit? Will he even want to try? \\n And will anyone be able to find a way to rescue Lavender from her persnickety ways once and for all? Find out in this comedic tale of princes, dragons, and dreams that just may come true. \\n About the Author \\n I was born in the frozen wasteland of Alaska with the unfortunate stigma of being both a daydreamer and left-handed. Starting from an early age, I\\'ve filled my life with stories of every sort from my father\\'s hunting trips to the Holy Trilogy (read: Star Wars). In the fourth grade, I became more interested in telling stories of my own than listening to those of others. Doctors--being doctors--attempted to medicate them out of me, but the best cure has always been a pen, a notebook, and my crazy, unrestrained imagination. \\n I continue to whittle away at these stories in my endless search for the one that will finally bring me back to reality.

I think this could've been a fantastic book, but the rookie writing mistakes made it hard to get through.\", 'This is such a cute book and it is a good book to read to children. They would love it and learn so much from it.', 'Lots of running around in this book, but not much adventure. The main characters never really seem to get anywhere.

She still has us reading the Christmas book so I picked up this one for her for Valentines Day. I love the sweetness of the story. Goose tells Duck that he's feeling sad, but before he can say what he needs, Duck jumps in with suggestions and ways to help. Lots of them. Until finally at the end he manages to tell Duck what he really needs, and he gets his hug from his good friends. \\n There are Duck and Goose books with more text so children can grow with these characters. I also bought a couple of these for my granddaughter and I'm eager to see if she loves them as much.\", 'Creepy as all hell.

I also like the friendship between Jesse and Daisy and the way that they care for their dragon Emmy.

The little girl kisses her GG goodbye and tells her she loves her with all her heart. \\n I can barely keep from sobbing as I write this review. This was such a moving story, done so sensitively and the illustrations bring to life GG and Mamela's special relationship. I really appreciated the way the author approached the topic of death and dying, and Lilly's reactions were so believable and real. At the conclusion of the story there is a delightful chicken soup recipe to engage the reader even further. \\n The foreword by Dr Laura Brock, gives the parent reader much to think about when approaching this topic with little ones.

I got this book last night and started reading it right away. I read for a good 3 hours before bed and then again this morning until finally I sat down after supper just now and finished it. I have to say its a fun quick read that will make you drool for candy. \\n This story is about 4 characters who after the candy contest in the first book have all become friends. There's Logan the grandson of the original candymaker at Life is Sweet, Daisy the spy, Philip the rich kid and Miles the caring best friend. \\n These characters all have different and interesting personalities.

Yet there has always been something intriguing about the work. And I'm actively looking for things to read to my two year old, both now and in the future. So I read the first Moomin book. I liked it. \\n The Moomins and the Great Flood doesn't read much like the ending was well-planned or the path to that ending much thought about. But what comes across is charm and the sheer joy of invention. My hero so far is Moominmamma. She rocks. I look forward to reading the later books.\", 'Lovely.

A lovely story.', 'It goes on and on and on...I got very bored. I read it in the 6th grade and I hated it.', \"In poetic lines, Henson paints a picture of Cal's life as a farm boy in the Appalachian Mountains. He helps with the plowing and caring for the livestock, while his younger sister sits always reading. Cal doesn't like to read, because he hates to sit still that long and he really resents it when his sister tries to teach him things. Cal is the first to hear the approaching horse when the Book Lady comes to their farm. She has a bag filled with books, and Cal's father tries to barter for a few, but the Book Lady leaves the books for free! And will return in a few weeks with more! Of course, Cal really doesn't care, until that is the Book Lady comes to their house in the middle of a winter storm solely to deliver books. Cal realizes that there is something more than the physical books driving her, and he intends to find out what it is. \\n Henson's long slim stanzas on each page, echo the lanky figure of Cal. They also evoke a certain solitude and strength in their structure. And like Cal, there is much more than meets the eye. In those slim stanzas, readers will find evocative images and real depth of thought. It is all done without losing young readers, instead drawing them further into the story. This book is masterfully written. \\n Small's pictures also evoke the lonely quality of life in the mountains. At the same time, they are often centered upon family as Cal's life is. Lamps and fires glow warmly, and though the rooms are spare they are filled with people and light. This is not a cold existence, but a loving solitary one. Small has captured the feel of solitude without loneliness entering his images. \\n Highly recommended, this book will expose children to the importance early libraries and librarians put in books. It could be used by modern librarians to start a conversation about the importance of books even though there is no need today for horses. I can see it being used by our Book Mobile Ladies too, an added connection to the history of mobile library service. Really though, it is wonderful enough that it can be read and shared with all sorts of children in all kinds of libraries, classrooms and families. Appropriate for ages 5-9.\", \"Floca's charming illustrations perfectly match the endearing nature of the true story - an elephant seal who, against the odds, keeps swimming back to her favorite spot near a riverbank in New Zealand.

They admire Audrey, and that comes across beautifully in the story and in the illustrations. \\n I have always admired Audrey Hepburn: her acting and dancing, and particularly her work for UNICEF. But, I learned so much about her early life, including her time during WWII (including a UN tie-in), some about her struggles, her hard work, her motherhood, how she treated the crews when she starred in movies, and most importantly her lifelong outlook on life and self. I\\'d never realized how much she overcame by hard work, sense, and most importantly never being anybody but herself. Here is someone I\\'d feel perfectly comfortable to have young people emulate.

I still remember how vividly I empathised with Norah, struggling to fit in at school and terribly ashamed when she finds herself wetting the bed again on top of already feeling unwanted at her new home. \\n With the war so far removed from our times, I think this book is an important one to read and consider for readers of all ages for the story it tells, taking us back to the chaos of war-time and how it affected people of all ages.\", 'The illustrations are hilarious.', 'Another favorite from the Golden Books collection.', 'A beautifully illustrated story about how a cave boy domesticates a wolf to become the first dog. Gives a child a good understanding of why a human and a wolf might join forces. Pair with From Wolf to Woof: The Story of Dogs to expand on that process and, if you want, to discuss evolution a bit, and with Wolf Camp about a domesticated dog who desperately wants to be a wolf, and you have a nice mini-lesson with some giggles as well.', \"This faux encyclopedia of weird animal hybrids is...odd. I can see it sitting alongside books like Aviary Wonders Inc. Spring Catalog and Instruction Manual and other imaginative oddities. \\n The illustrations show the artist's talent, yet they feel like the plates of older animal encyclopedias-muted colors and a nostalgic glossy-page sort of feel. \\n Yet the curious animals and small verses are fun and entertaining. I'm not sure of the audience for this book, but it is curious nonetheless.\", 'This was originally called The Silver Sword', 'Das Buch begann sehr klischeehaft und kindisch, aber vielleicht liegt es auch nur daran, dass ich nicht mehr unbedingt zur Zielgruppe des Buches gehore.

I have practically read almost all of Shel Silverstein\\'s works including Where the Sidewalk Ends, A Light in the Attic, and Every Thing on It and I had enjoyed every single one of them! Now, I have finally read another one of Shel Silverstein\\'s books called \"Falling Up\" and it was just as enjoyable as Shel Silverstein\\'s other works! \\n This is another book that has a set of Shel Silverstein\\'s famous poems and some of the poems featured in this book include: \\n FALLING UP \\n I tripped on my shoelace \\n And I fell up- \\n Up to the roof tops, \\n Up over the town, \\n Up past the tree tops, \\n Up over the mountains, \\n Up where the colors \\n Blend into the sounds. \\n But it got me so dizzy \\n When I looked around, \\n I got sick to my stomach \\n And I threw down. \\n Once again, Shel Silverstein had piqued my interest in his talent for writing surreal and hilarious poetry that interest children as well as adults! I loved the wacky style that Shel Silverstein puts into the poems as the characters are always doing bizarre things such as in the poem \"Complainin\\' Jack\" where a Jack-in-a-box just complains all day and in the poem \"Rotten Convention\" where there is a vast array of horrible characters such as Hamburger Face and Gruesome Grace attending a convention. I also loved Shel Silverstein\\'s artwork as it is mostly in black and white colorings and is truly surreal to look at. Probably my favorite illustrations in this book was of the image of the pet lion in the poem \"Unfair\" as it looked incredibly creepy and surreal at the same time and the characters from the poem \"Rotten Convention\" as they look truly frightening and surreal, especially the image of a man who has a knife going through his head. \\n Parents should know that like most of Shel Silverstein\\'s books, there are some poems that might either frighten children or cause them to perform the crazy stunts that the characters did in this book. Probably some of the most suggestive poems in this book would be \"Crazy Dream\" which involves a child having a dream about torturing his teachers and that might convince small children to do the same and \"Spoiled Brat\" where a child is eaten alive which would frighten small children. Parents should probably read this book before they show it to their children to see if they can handle the content in this book. \\n Overall, \"Falling Up\" is a truly brilliant book that contains some of Shel Silverstein\\'s most memorable poems and many adults and children will definitely enjoy the wacky humor of these poems! I would highly recommend this book to children ages six and up since there are some suggestive content in this book that adults might want to discuss with their children about. \\n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog', 'April is Poetry month AND Library Month!

I remember having him and my mom read it over and over!', 'http://www.sonderbooks.com/Childrens_...', \"The Great Unexpected by Sharon Creech is one of those books that gets right into things, much like this review, and doesn't diddle daddle. The novel features two girls, Naomi and Lizzie who meet a young man named Finn who fell from a tree and seems to act very peculiar. To be honest, I felt like there wasn't a specific plot and that the novel just went on its way, much like life. Whether it is a good thing or a bad I'm not exactly sure. I've read a couple of novels where a plot was not exactly set out in plain sight. When I say much like life, I mean that the novel doesn't have a grand purpose and seems to gear towards great unexpected situations, pun intended. \\n Finn seems to be unknowingly accompanied by an older man who is asking too many questions in the small town. Meanwhile, on the other side of the ocean in Ireland, two women seem to talk a bunch of crazy talk that only makes sense towards the end. Aside from the odd vague plot, the book was actually pretty amazing. It kept me guessing what the purpose of the story was and there would be times where characters would say something that would connect to another character saying something previously. I actually spent two hours or so in bed putting little things together and figuring out the big picture. \\n The characters for a start were superb. Lizzie, the main characters best friend, has a very theatrical aura in her written character. From the way she speaks and by her actions it's as if she's an actress overacting her part and its fantastic! Others, such as Witch Wiggins and Crazy Cora, were also interesting and even though half of the time it was false, the rumors we hear about hem are entertaining. Most of the other characters also have interesting dialogue that felt absolutely refreshing and set me in the world of the book. \\n The writing was actually, like I said before, very refreshing. There would be times where characters would mock a certain type of speaking dialogue as if they were in the English Country during the 17th Century. I found it pretty hilarious because I, at times, do the same thing. As I was reading the book, I kept picturing everything in vivid, pastel colors of green, pink, yellow and blue. It is an odd thing to say but this book made me see colors. I also enjoyed the fact that Ireland played a good part of the novel because I love Ireland and Irish people so I felt this interesting connection. \\n All in all, the novel was a good one even though it is for children. I loved that it was a fast, light read that's great for any ages with an amazing ending that makes you feel good. Gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside. I had never heard of Sharon Creech before, but now, because of The Great Unexpected I am tempted to check out her other books and see how good they make me feel.\", 'This is a great book. Excellent way to teach children about migration, climate, seasons and geography. Fantastic full page illustrations with large text and no dead space. The layout design was skillfully done. The writing by Cohn gave just enough insight to fully explain yet still open up to more questions and was fun and playful.

We will be reading this book together often.', 'This young adult dystopian science fiction novel (the first of a trilogy, followed by a prequel) is considered to be a classic, and it\\'s easy to see why. The Tripods (machines? living beings? robots gone wrong? aliens from another world?) rule over the post-apocalyptic Earth, keeping humans in their (faux-medieval) place by means of \"capping\" them at puberty: that is, surgically implanting metal helmet-like contraptions on people to keep them docile and content. Young Will, the protagonist, flees his capping, and thus his coming-of-age adventure begins. \\n This is a \"big idea\" novel, and the characters are developed just enough to serve the plot and no more. That said, the big idea is a key one, namely the question of whether it\\'s better to choose the security, safety, and contentment of being a servant, or to choose to be one\\'s own master, even if that means living a life of danger and hardship and want. At its worst, the novel is wooden and predictable, but at its best, it\\'s a compelling and thought-provoking young-adult treatment of a timeless issue. Considering how John Christopher contrasts the peaceful but uninspired stagnation of the novel\\'s current day with the chaotic but excitinh innovation and progress represented by the ruins of the cities of our time, it\\'s easy to recognize the conclusions he draws about the ultimate value of individuality.', \"Lois Lenski did this wonderful series about working children in America. They are somewhat out of date (they usually take place in the first half of the 20th century) but that doesn't make them less moving. Also, issues of poverty and class are ALWAYS relevant, and books like Cotton in My Sack and Strawberry Girl do a wonderful job of getting that conversation going with a young person. \\n I read this at the same time as Nickle and Dimed and there were plenty of disturbing parallels.

Even though Kenra's ancestor had gotten her formulae from her ancestor, who was a slave, she had no proof. Ruthie and Jack find a book of recipes, but also a cryptic note that they should talk to Isabelle. They do, and find out that she worked with Mrs. Thorne and knows that a will was drawn up clearing Kendra's relative. The will must be in the rooms somewhere, where it was put for safekeeping, and the children need to find it. Jack also wants to find an ancestor of his own-- Jack Norfleet, a pirate! After meeting him, however, Jack starts to fade away, and Ruthie has to go back and set things right so that Jack doesn't cease to exist.

I think maybe it fell a little short in the story telling, and wasn\\'t explained very well. It is appropriate for slightly older kids maybe 5-7 (so I don\\'t know why it is a board book) as opposed to toddlers like Munchkin who while enjoy acting out the kissing of hands and putting them to cheeks don\\'t quite understand the reasoning.

Sophie's World is the story of a 14-year-old girl by the name of 'Sophie Amundsen' who returns home one day to find these notes 'Who are you?' and 'Where does the world come from?' in her mailbox, along with another note addressed to a certain 'Hilde' whom Sophie doesn't know. Imagine the confusion of this girl! From here starts interesting series of Philosophy lessons for Sophie by a mysterious philosopher. \\n As suggested on the cover page, the novel is a History of Philosophy. Starting from the question of 'What is philosophy?' , the book breezes over the periods of Myths and legends of Thor to famous philosophers like Socrates and Aristotle. It takes us on a tour of Medieval Ages philosophy and ends with the theories of Sigmund Freud. It is an interesting read, not only because the book provides us with enlightenment on philosophy, but also keeps you guessing about the mystery of 'Hilde' and her connection to 'Sophie'. \\n Read more on \\n Notes and Musings by Soumya Veer\", 'This book was hilarious!

I am not a huge fan of short stories, but in this collection the stories are linked because they are all about the same family, so they read more like an episodic novel. This leads to a couple of inconsistencies, but nothing that matters: you simply accept that they were written over a long period, when the author felt like adding to them.

I mean, it's one of the most famous books of all time, and will likely remain to be read by many in the future. I finally decided to read this in an audio-book format and it was quite a magical experience. \\n The story itself is very (thankfully) different to the Burton adaptation, featuring the young girl we all know who falls down a rabbit hole, and her adventures in Wonderland. Chaos follows, and there seems to be no limit as to what can happen in this incredibly built world. While I adored the brilliant imagery and boundless imagination, the scene with Alice in a sea of her own tears is particularly interesting, this seemed a little too far for me. I didn't really like Alice's character, she came across as a little rude and not really somebody that I could relate to. However, I absolutely adored the Queen of Hearts. I wasn't quite sure whether to laugh or be terrified, and her husband was just as amusing. \\n While this certainly wasn't what I expected, I can see why some may fall in love with the nonsensical magic - both children and adults alike.

Yes, they fell down and hill and Jack indeed split his head open, but they were not sent up to fetch a pail of water. Oh no, they climbed a beanstalk, killed the giants, and then fell off the clouds. Why did they do this? Well, it has to do with finding a magic mirror or else they die. Of course, death and gore and horror lurk around every corner where Jack and Jill go in search of this magic mirror. If the giants don\\'t succeed in squashing them, then they might succomb to evil mermaids or devious goblins. Don\\'t forget the fire-breathing salamandar and the murderous Others. \\n At least the narrator is once again a reliable guide. He generously points out the places where it might be best to close your eyes or walk away from the book altogether. Except when he forgets. At least he apologizes after the blood and gore finishes dripping down the page. Just as I did in the first book, A Tale Dark and Grimm, I love the humor the narrator adds as he (or maybe she) interrupts the story to warn and taunt the reader. \\n Adam Gidwitz has created another hilarious (if somewhat bloody) romp through another collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymes with In a Glass Grimmly (Puffin Books 2012). Rather than connecting retold stories as he did in A Tale Dark and Grimm, he uses the fairy tales as inspiration and and jumping off point for original stories involving characters we thought we knew-llike the Frog Prince. He\\'s really just a frog, but a funny frog. \\n Even though this is a fun story to read, it explores big ideas that will resonate with readers young and old. For much of the story, Jack and Jill are con-fused. They can\\'t separate how they want others to see them from how they see themselves. It is only once they learn to see themselves clearly, that they find what they have been searching for all along. \\n Maybe that\\'s why fairy tales have such enduring power. Through tales of princesses and giants and enchantments, we learn to see more clearly through the fog that con-fuses us our \"real\" lives. Which fairy tales-fractured or not-help you to see life more clearly?', \"This book was good, but disappointing.

Yup, that's me! \\n This takes one through all the stories a fourth grader should be familiar with, mathematical concepts, science, history, etc. I find it fascinating. \\n I read Rip Van Winkle to my students because of this.

Or better. Since he's inclined to take it easy on her because she's a princess, and his Charm School of course teaches chivalry and all that sex role rot, the only way for her to compete with him on even footing is to enter the tournament disguised as a male competitor. \\n The big obstacle is her hair. She does contemplate cutting it off, but not for very long. For such a sporty girl, you'd think she'd realize her unbelievably long hair was holding her back. When you're at the point where you can trip on your own hair, it's too long! (You know.. we never have seen anyone climbing up her hair in these books. I think the witch climbs down once. But mostly she just pops into the tower with her magic witchy powers. Quite pointless.) \\n So, anyway, the other girls help her. Make her a school uniform, borrow a suit of armor, give her a horse to practice on, help her sneak out of school, etc etc. \\n I was surprised that so soon after the Let Down Your Hair debacle of a book that we had another story focussing on Rapunzel already. And it would be a theme I like. So far this rivals the book with the games for best of the series. \\n Sideplot has Snow trading a bag of apples for some magic beans from a kid named Jack. Which plot ends stupidly, but whatever. \\n Speaking of endings, I find the ending of the jousting tournament plot unbelievable as well. And unnecessary. Let me just say, hopefully without giving away the ending, that she's a first year princess, going up against first, second, third, and fourth years boys (perhaps 13-14 is the oldest, at a guess) who have studied jousting in school. Even with her 'outside the box' thinking on tactics, just how well can she reasonably expect to do? \\n Anyway, the detail of the jousting is enough to make me think the authors researched a bit there. All I really know about it is you come at each other with long pointy sticks. How accurate that detail is, I don't know, but I'll believe it. \\n Two books left. Hrm, and unlike the previous books, there's no hint at the end of this one as to what the next one is about. As the title involves apples though, I'm going to assume it's about Snow White. Maybe that giant comes after her. Or she befriends Jack. I hope not. Jack was a real jerk.\", \"Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer.

His new dog does not behave the way his imaginary dog did - but they still have wonderful new adventures. And Nino decides to use his imagination to create other imaginary animal friends. \\n This book was originally written in Flemish by the Belgian author Edward van de Vendel. It was illustrated by Anton Van Hertbruggen. The illustrations are on the dark side of the color spectrum - lots of forest greens and browns - so it is not as bright as some picture books.

It could be paired with Santat\\'s \"The Adventures of Beekle\" and Sendak\\'s \"Where the Wild Things Are\". For older children, it might be used with Applegate\\'s \"Crenshaw\" to expand on the concept of imaginary friends.

But when they drill the first hole, they see orange not gray. Perhaps it's an orange aardvark come to eat them! They drill another hole and that one shows blue, so they think it's an orange aardvark wearing blue pajamas. As they drill more holes, more colors are shown and their story about the orange aardvark gets more and more elaborate. Savvy young readers will know what all of these colors mean, but the pleasure of this book is seeing just how silly the little ants become. \\n Hall is the author of My Heart Is Like a Zoo and continues to display his skill with bright colors, large formats and die cuts in this new title. The mix of surprise, guessing and silliness makes this book great fun to read. Add in identifying different colors and the book becomes almost a game to read aloud. Even better, there is wonderful suspense with each page turn as the ants come up with their next spectacular speculation. \\n Done in large format and pops of bright colors, the illustrations have the same appeal as Lois Ehlert and Eric Carle with their sharp edges and cut paper format. The die cuts are used just enough to make the book more suspenseful and fun.

The novel has strong emotional appeal--the story of how Ivan ended up at the mall is a sad tale and this book could be a difficult read for children who are highly sensitive. \\n Overall, I think children who enjoy animal books (especially stories based on true stories) and children who enjoy books with strong emotional appeal will enjoy this novel.', 'When it comes to daddy time, two little kids sure know how to have fun. \\n Daddy is seriously the best horsey ever. Apparently, rustlers thinks so too and they horse-nap him, but the kids are resourceful and they track the hoof prints that daddy leaves behind. \\n From a rodeo, to a circus to a polo match and even a trip to Canada where the children reveal their true identities, the band of rustlers have no idea what they are up against. \\n As the sun begins to set on their adventures, mom appears at the back door with wide-open arms and the kids know what that mean - she seriously is the best at airplane rides. \\n This is a good book for your creative thinking adventure seekers. Every child loves playing horsey and when you throw in a dad that is just as involved, you cannot help but to have the time of your lives.', \"Audience: Toddler / Preschool \\n Illustrations: Adorable and quirky! \\n Plot / Review: Readers follow Santa on his way through town to deliver presents. Children can guess who is on the other side of the window (cut-out) of each page. Some are easier to guess than others, but it's entertaining the whole way through. This is just the cutest little participation story ever! \\n Read Aloud: Yes, but it might be a little small for large groups.\", 'I received a copy of this book from Capstone via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.', \"Chris Raschka is known for his ability to get to the essence of things with minimal words and deceptively simple illustrations. He's hit the mark again in this new series that, frankly, should be board books. They're perfectly aimed at babies and toddlers who will want to read them again and again, and even these sturdy paper pages won't stand up to enthusiastic use. Where is Whaley Whale? Is she on the table? In the basket? Behind the door? Youngsters get a nice introduction to prepositions as they giggle with the knowledge that Whaley is under the chair. Swoopy illustrations, and the chortle-worthy concept of a whale hiding in the house make this a winner for the intended audience, who have been known to play the hiding game themselves.\", \"I wanted to love this book, but I just didn't.

Apparently there was a woman who came up a few minutes before they were supposed to be selling. Now you have to understand my mother had been standing there for an hour \"in line\" but it just happened to be a line that consisted only of her. So she had been talking to the women running the booth. Well this other woman came up and had apparently promised this book to her small child. She just assumed she would get what she want.

She likes to think of herself as a superhero, her power being... empathy. Hmm. Cute? Maybe? Sure, whatever. Anyway, what makes me want to hit this book are Grace's stupid parents. She does this nice thing for some old lady, but because she didn't like, inform her parents of her every freakin' move they punish her... for doing something nice... It was like the end of an episode of Full House, where one of the kids gets reprimanded for doing FUCKING NOTHING (like hey, you made me cookies? Sweet! But hey, look here, looks like you FORGOT TO CLEAN THE CRUMBS OFF THE GODDAMNED COUNTER AND MUST NOW BE BEATEN... and then we can hug later andokaybye!) So everything that happened before punishment was was fine (not very interesting, but not bad), and then the author goes and gives you this ending where the message is a piece of crap: Be meek, don't be a good person unless you have written permission.

I liked everything about this book but a thing I really liked was when Jesse said \"On Fursdays Da Fing gets cwampy in his hole, so he comes out of it.\" I learned that when something very sad happens you can\\'t keep thinking about it for the rest of your life. I loved this book and I want to read it every day forever. \\n DAUGHTER SAYS: I liked everything about this book,so it is hard to pick favorite parts, but if I had to pick favorite parts they would be when Jesse keeps suddenly saying new names of creatures and everyone says \"What?\". I learned that when somethings sad things happen in the past you can\\'t live your life holding onto that memory. I loved this book and I want to read it again without knowing what happens!! \\n MOM\\'S BOTTOM LINE: From the Magical Mind of Mindy Munson is a wonderfully told story that features sympathetic and richly developed characters; evokes a roller coaster of emotions; and provides both amusing and poignant moments. While the underlying plot features a tragedy, the author deals with this by injecting magical elements and humor that will be enjoyed by children and their caregivers. I highly recommend this little gem especially as a read-aloud book to children ages 7 to 12.

At the end was a commentary on the pictures, in which we are told what the artists were trying to capture. \\n As for the actual speech, I do not know what more to add to the endless commentary. This speech was one that King had been giving throughout 1963 (most famously you can still find the last proto-version of the speech he gave in Detroit of that year) and it starts by reminding the crowd that it had only been 100 years since the Emancipation Proclamation and that African-Americans had been issued a check marked \"insufficient funds\" and it goes on from there to become the great (possibly over-celebrated) speeches of the 20th century. \\n Just for the curious. here is Dr. King looking back at this speech in the context of the Vietnam War:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYGtT...', \"This book has a great message: you should be yourself, not just follow along and do the same stuff all the time.

I recently read it to my own children and had the uncomfortable realization that this story might have played (at least a small) part in my struggles with codependency issues, both in childhood and into adulthood. The boy/man is rather selfish, and the tree gives until she has nothing left. As a child I thought it was the ultimate act of love, but as an adult it's easy to see how unhealthy and disturbingly imbalanced nature of this relationship. \\n Needless to say I set the book aside and decided to read it to my boys when they're old enough for us to talk about the negative aspects of this kind of relationship. I'm not sure if Silverstein intended the book to inspire conversations about the positive/negative nature of relationships, or if he, like many people, really believed this kind of relationship should be glorified, but I'm going to use it to help teach my kids that respect, trust and balanced give and take are the keys to healthy relationships. And about how a relationship that lacks these things, no matter how heroic or romantic it may seem, can have very negative consequences for everyone involved.\", \"Little Kid Reaction: My boys LOVED this book.

This is one we read a lot! \\n Big Kid Reaction: I loved the message: sharing is GOOD. I also loved the way the book is presented. The author, illustrator, and editor have created two worlds in the manner of the famous Wizard of Oz movie. The real world is black and white (sparse light pink highlights), with Arial font type, and prose writing. The fantasy world is FLOODED with color, with Curlz font type, and rhyming text. When he returns to reality, he is back to his normal world again. Just beautifully done.

I approached a re-read with caution and rediscovered that Charles Tritten was Spyri's translator and a personal friend and that alone made it more of a sequel and less of a cashing in on a famous book kind of thing. It reads pretty faithfully to the original - though Peter seems to have grown a few brain cells in the interval - and I take it kindly that Tritten says he wrote to two books because children were asking for the story and Spyri herself would never have refused any child's request, especially after her only son died. The simple morality that flows through Heidi survives and into the next one too.\", \"3,5 stelline in realta. \\n Non mi aspettavo molto da questo libro (che ammetto, ho comprato per la copertina e le pagine nere XD), mentre in realta e ben scritto scorrevole.

The best character is Mrs. Floofy Pants, or Mrs. Pigeon-Smythe by her true name. She cracks up at the pen, just as I did with this book. The illustrations are fun and engaging. That is one aspect of the book that I enjoyed. It is visually appealing and engaging. I always enjoy the book more if you really need the illustrations to get the full tale!

It's as if people are angry that this series hasn't gotten the same crazed treatment and/or think that they are somehow 'better' than Potter nerds for loving it? \\n I dunno guys. I'm willing to bet we were all pretty weird in primary school, so no need to be superior about which brand of British escapism we took.

I think that even if your mg reader isn't in the theater or arts spotlight, they could connect with Nate in a different way. Whether you are a dancer, painter, singer, or lacrosse player, or any other sport or arts genre, this story will touch your heart. Great job, Tim Federle.\", \"I know why I loved this book when I was younger. Reading it as an adult, I think it may not be good for all young readers. It's a little advanced and with a cat named S.O.B. and an adult trying to kill an 11 year old, it is probably better for more advanced younger readers. \\n Be that as it may, it's well written. The characters are all realistic. The suspense is done very well. I admit I was skimming at the end because it was almost too much for me. I can be a bit of a scaredy cat at times! Speaking of cats, I LOVED S.O.B. He was tough, but had a soft side he shared with Rob, the 11 year old protagonist. He was my favorite character actually. \\n My one complaint about the book isn't a complaint about the book itself, but against the adult characters in it. No one listened to the poor kid until it was almost too late. I think the moral if the story is directed more towards adults than kids. It's that kids are important too and to pay attention to them. Just because you are an adult doing important adult things, doesn't mean that you or your things are more important than children. I'm not saying worship kids, like too many parents do nowadays, but listen to them. Treat them with respect. Expect great things from them and they will deliver. Kids aren't all equal, just like all adults aren't, but don't just discount someone because of their age, young or old. \\n Great book, quick read and it has multiple levels to enjoy.

Harry is bombed out, loses his entire family, and rather than be taken in by smothering Cousin Elsie he strikes out on his own. Right in the beginning he meets a bombed-out dog who becomes his protector and closest companion. He begins by living under a boat on the beach at Newcastle for a few days, and eventually works his way up the coast to Lindisfarne--living hand to mouth, making it. \\n [After making a list of the book\\'s incidents] I discovered a very interesting thing. I was trying to remember a character\\'s name, and realized she doesn\\'t ever identify herself as anything but \"the Mermaid\"--her father\\'s old name for her. There is another character in the book who is actually named Merman. Both characters are after Harry\\'s affection, the touch of his youth, brightness, attention. The Mermaid\\'s \"seduction\" works in a different way from Merman\\'s (which is overtly sexual), but Harry does lift her up, eat her food, sleep in her bed wearing her son\\'s clothes. It\\'s like he\\'s always seduced by the sea--the sea creatures keep coming at him as he makes his way along the shore--and they\\'re always dangerous, and if he listens to the siren\\'s song he\\'s always on the verge of drowning, of getting in over his head. \\n Which happens *literally* on his way back from Lindisfarne (where he has a bad run-in with local kids and, in the absolute cold blood of necessity, deliberately and consciously breaks a kid\\'s ankle), when Harry\\'s caught by the tide, soaked to the skin, and ends up spending the night in a refuge tower in the middle of the flooded causeway. \\n And check this out--after his fight with the sea itself, which he wins (gets himself and his dog safe into the tower), it says: \"The very air he breathed was full of salty spray, so that he breathed a mixture of air and water, half boy, half fish.\" \\n He\\'s turned into a merman himself! And sure enough, the next character he ends up with--Mr. Murgatroyd--Harry asks directly, \"Can I help?\" Expecting seduction of some kind, but this time he\\'s prepared for it. And Mr. M. says, \"Help? Help with what?\" So Harry\\'s taken the offensive and offered his services--it turns out that what he\\'s needed for now is to be a substitute son--and Harry wins over the locals himself to work out the kinks in the plan. He ends up spending the rest of the summer there. \\n Mr. M wants to adopt him, so they go back to Newcastle to work things out--and discover that Harry\\'s family completely survived the bombing, but were tossed by the blast into the neighbor\\'s yard so the wardens thought they were a different family. You think this is a happy ending, the great reunion? There\\'s a twist. \\n Dad says, \"A big lad like you, running away?\" \\n Dulcie, the sister says, \"And you weren\\'t even *scratched*...Cowardy cowardy custard.\" \\n Harry thinks of \"his whole kingdom, that he\\'d found himself, made for himself. And on the other side, these shabby angry bossy people... full of whining self-pity for what *they* had suffered. Narrow, narrow...\" \\n So Mr. M. drives away with the dog and leaves Harry to his family, where he\\'ll have to \"keep his own mouth shut, over all the years... before he got back to his kingdom by the sea.\" \\n But you know he will, because he\\'s amphibious now--he can live in the water *or* on the land. \\n ------------------------------------- \\n Reading this book again nearly 20 years later, I find the narrow-minded reception of his return to his family to be a little too forced. But it\\'s still a great book. \\n ------------------------------------ \\n Tori: Lindisfarne is Windy Isle--this book was my first encounter with the Northumbrian coast!

I am not Jewish, so the words and traditions were completely unfamiliar to me; however, author Lori Kline provides a short glossary of terms at the end of the book, so I just started there! (Side note: at first, when I saw the word \"G-d\\'s,\" I thought it was a typo. When I saw it again, I decided to do some research and learned even more about Jewish tradition. The incomplete spelling is indeed intentional.) \\n The book cover was just chosen for an upcoming cover of Publisher\\'s Weekly - and I am not surprised. Susan Simon\\'s artwork (and I am calling it artwork, not illustrations for a reason) is precious. Her pages are full of color and emotion, evocative, and just feel good. There is a comfort in looking at the pages. Simon gets just the right expressions on the characters\\' faces, and their eyes perfectly reflect Kline\\'s words. Simon uses colors and textures to create the changing moods from scene to scene, all in harmony with author Lori Kline\\'s lovely words. (So harmonious, in fact, that I teared-up by the beauty, sadness, and familiarity of one part.) \\n Almost A Minyan is told through rhyme, and readers will hear the voice of our main character, who is never named - perhaps because she represents all females on the verge of taking steps towards bigger things? The rhyming sentences are well-written and flow so that there is a definite rhythm and cadence to the book. It would be a wonderful read-aloud story, but I also can see how readers of any age would like to experience it alone (and I\\'d recommend a print copy for maximum enjoyment and easy flipping back and forth to the glossary). I disagreed with some end punctuation in a place or two and spotted a capitalization error, but I am doubtful most readers will notice, and it certainly didn\\'t affect my enjoyment of this thoughtful, informative, sentimental book. \\n Thank you to Lone Star Book Blog Tours and Sociosights Press for providing me an eBook in exchange for my honest opinion - the only kind I give.

Remember The Color Kittens and The Poky Little Puppy? Golden Books created a sensational business model that sold thousands of books at very inexpensive prices in supermarkets and began careers for many illustrators like Richard Scarry and the Provensons. At one point they were so successful that the Little Fat Policeman was given to every rookie NYPD cop in their orientation packet in the fifties. \\n By the late nineties, however, a company that had enthralled two generations of children was on hard times and subject to takeover bids and buyouts. A desperate attempt was made to capture the school market with the Road-to-Reading series (my wife\\'s Little Prince Know It All was part of that series although she did not illustrate that title.)

Why that man is not a canonized saint is baffling to me, but this review is not the place for that platform. In an interview in 1979, he was praised for his accomplishments and lauded for the various important people he had met throughout the world. He was then asked, who he considered to be the biggest inspiration to him. In his humility, Sheen responded that he had never met his biggest inspiration, but that it was an eleven year old Chinese girl and her love for the Eucharist that inspired him most. 32 Days: A Story of Faith and Courage tells the story of that girl. \\n Pei was a village girl who lived in China. Like most children, she had parents, siblings, and grandparents. They worked hard and didn\\'t have a lot, but they loved each other and loved Jesus too. Within their village, there was a Catholic Church, a priest, and a school run by a Catholic nun. Things were quiet for the most part until the Communists took over the village. Everything changed at that point. The Communists used propaganda techniques, intimidation, and fear to try and \"convert\" people to this change in regime. In addition to imprisoning the priest, one of their worst atrocities was destroying the Church and everything inside of it. They even desecrated the Eucharist by throwing it on the ground and stepping on it. Pei witnessed all of this and felt helpless about it, but one day she resolved to go consume the sacred hosts, as that was Jesus and she longed for Him. There were 32 hosts, so she had to sneak out at night 32 times to do this. She was almost caught several times, and sadly, on the 32nd night she was. She was martyred that night, but during that month+, she grew closer to Jesus than most of us do in our lifetime. The book was an easy read, and one that I was able to read in about an hour.

Manuela Pentangelo, the illustrator, has crafted ice-cream-parlor-delicious artwork. On the accompanying audio-book CD (available separately) the book is performed in English (2 versions), Italian and Spanish (2 versions.) As children listen to the different performances, they cannot help but develop an appreciation for the beauty of different languages. Just by listening, they pick up many Italian and Spanish words, and start to develop an appreciation of different cultures.Like the Pixar movie, Monsters, Inc., this book allows children to discover the fact that a monster might be as afraid of them, but it does it in a very different, almost cerebral way. Also, as children read the story, they find a mantra that they can say to themselves to banish monsters, \"You\\'re welcome to stay, until I say \\'nay,\\' then it\\'s time to go, and you can\\'t say no.\" Children love to have magic enchantments, and this mantra can provide great comfort. - Brenda Silver - Book Reviewer eZineArticles.com', 'No se ni por donde empezar...

En teoria, las gemas son agenero, pero se las trata de <<ellas>>. \\n Todo en este comic es precioso, empezando por el arte. No tengo mucha idea pero estoy casi segura de que es acuarela (quiza usando esponjas??). En fin, la cuestion es que casa muy bien con lo que se esta contando.

Mientras que Sapphire tiene la vida resuelta y planificada por ser una gema aristocrata especial; Ruby, impulsiva, valiente, es una gema comun con nada que perder. Me encanta ver como se entrelazan dos mundos tan distintos, que no tenian derecho a permanecer conjuntamente mas que la breve duracion de una mision, y que sin quererlo, los cambios en los acontecimientos al renegar de sus destinos separados dan a entender justo lo contrario: que esas dos vidas, desde el primer instante de su encuentro, quieren realmente formar algo completamente nuevo. Espontaneamente, si, como la vida misma. \\n Aqui es cuando Rebecca Sugar te llama la atencion para decirte que <<Eh, esta bien no tener las cosas claras en la vida, es valido tener dudas, no estas sola.>> Mira Rose y Pearl, por ejemplo, al oponerse a las ideas imperialistas de Homeworld, ellas tampoco saben que les deparara el futuro. Lo unico que saben es que haran lo posible por defender su causa. \\n Por supuesto, no es facil, Garnet esta ahora abrumada con una crisis existencial enorme porque las visiones del futuro de Sapphire son erroneas por haber colisionado con la naturaleza despreocupada de Ruby. Poco importa de todas formas, ya que ahora pueden recorrer ese camino de autodescubrimiento juntas, y tal vez en ese proceso, se den cuenta de que su relacion amorosa era la respuesta correcta.

The night is young, and the chase has just begun. \\n I remember liking this author in elementary school, and also being quite terrified by her books--I didn\\'t read much horror, and was scared rather easily (and both are still true today). \\n I didn\\'t find this book scary, however, as I once would have. It felt very predictable, so I had no reason to be afraid. Everything fell into place way too easily, to get both the kids and the criminal locked in together. However, once the story was actually moving, it felt more plausible. \\n Ellen was an annoying character at first, with her now being an \"adult\" and so \"mature\" just because she\\'s twelve. She stopped being annoying once in the zoo, and I grew to like her more and more as the book progressed. \\n Overall, not a bad book, but I don\\'t think I enjoy this author as much as I used to.', 'It is a consensus among historians that the selection of the best U. S. president ever is a contest between George Washington, Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. Washington was a figure that unified a new nation in the early years; Roosevelt saw the nation out of the depression and to victory in war while Lincoln managed to hold the country together through a bitter and very bloody civil war. \\n This is a brief history of Abraham Lincoln, his life of hard work and love of learning as he rose from living in a one-room cabin he helped build to his becoming a lawyer, running for office and failing and finally being elected president when the country was falling apart. The level of the text is roughly that of the second grader and the organization is where approximately two sentences are captioned under the image of the page. The images are colorful and drawn in great detail. \\n It is an excellent primer on the life of one of the greatest U. S. presidents of all time. He rose from humble beginnings and through his love of learning and reading rose to the highest office in the land. This is a lesson that is important and timeless. \\n This review appears on Amazon', 'The last page is hypnotic of this delightful book about going places.

The writing is really original and I think it is a book that, all though is aimed at middle graders, can be enjoyed by anyone. \\n I think the illustrations throughout the book added the perfect touch to the overall story and are perfect for younger ones to look at whilst reading. \\n The pacing of the story is perfect and the chapters are just the right length to keep you engaged.

Her books are inventive and often use fairy tale with powerful effect. \\n Operation Bunny starts with the discovery of a baby in a hatbox at Stansted Airport in Essex, just outside London. The little girl is named Emily Vole and is adopted by the narcissistic Daisy Dashwood and her husband Ronald. Emily is treated more like a doll than a child until Daisy has triplets of her own, at which point 5 year old Emily is moved from her opulent pink bedroom to sleep on the ironing board in the laundry room and forced to become a servant, looking after the house and babies. \\n Emily\\'s life would be very miserable if she wasn\\'t befriended by Miss String, the next door neighbour much despised by the Dashwoods, and her giant talking cat. Before long Emily discovers that she has inherited a magical shop and must defeat a fairy-hating witch whose magic lamp turns humans into pink bunnies, with the help from the cat, a fairy policeman and a grumpy detective called Buster. \\n In the press release from Orion, this enchanting book is compared to Roald Dahl. I\\'d say that apart from the Dashwoods, who are similar to the Wormwoods in Matilda, it reminds me more of Eva Ibbotson\\'s books for younger readers. I loved it, and can\\'t wait for the next one! It would be devoured by 7+ as an independent read, and 6+ as a bed time story. \\n My one quibble is that I felt the authorial disapproval of the Dashwoods very strongly (although Daisy does get to redeem herself) and it makes me a little uncomfortable in the way that Dahl\\'s disapproval of \"common\" parents does. However, the Cinderella aspects of the story clearly need a weak father and unkind mother, and the pantomime tone makes it funny.', 'This is a fun romance about two people who are happiest in their jail cell where they have stolen all the beauties of the world.

Snakes, horses, and adventures await in this new, wild territory she now calls home. \\n This book got off to a rough start. The first chapter was really choppy and lacked any sort of direction. It felt like I was reading the tedious minute-by-minute happenings of the characters' morning. Part of the problem was that I read this book on the heels of another book that I devoured. Another part of the problem was that I kept forgetting this was a midde grade title, not a young adult title. \\n Thankfully, the book got better. The first chapter was a bit of a flop, but chapter 2 picked up and the rest of the book was much more enjoyable. It had some funny parts and some sad parts.

One Twims narrates the book, explaining life in the valley. He lives in a House Tree up on the cliffs. He has many siblings, a mother and a father and two sets of grandparents. He plays games in the woods, watches all sorts of weather arrive, including once children falling from a house picked up by a hurricane. Twims use theater to get over feeling angry, have a cemetery with grave markers that speak to the interests of the Twims buried there, and enjoy the changes of each season. \\n First published in France, this book has a gorgeous otherworldly feel to it. It balances the wonder of these little creatures with the small details of their lives. It strongly reminded me of my childhood love for the Gnomes book by Wil Huygen. This new book touches those same emotions, the exploration of something small and clever, the beauty of a simple life and the magic inherent in it as well. \\n Ponti's illustrations are lovely. He intersperses the image on the cover of the book throughout the book, focusing on the valley as it changes through different kinds of seasons and weather. The valley almost becomes so familiar that readers will identify with it themselves as each type of event makes it all the more spectacular.

It seems as if the author wanted to account for any type of loss, whether through divorce, death, or incarceration, but in so doing, added a bit of confusion to the story.

More than the record of a bedtime tete-a-tete between a young girl and her compassionate pet cat, Who Loves Me? is medicine for the child's soul that can be expertly applied just by a parent or loved one reading it to them. Prompted by the various ways the young girl in the book's loved ones show how they feel about her, we begin to think on how our own parents, grandparents, siblings, pets, and friends demonstrate they care for us. It's a much-needed reminder for readers of any age, and author and illustrator work together admirably to present it. \\n Loved ones show their feelings in diverse ways, and these differences are part of the charm of being loved by many. A mother or father's love may be obvious because of all the things they do for us, the sacrifices they cheerfully make for no other reason than that it pleases them to put us first. They love us, so they happily place our needs ahead of their own. A grandparent's love is often just as selfless, if with a dash more pizzaz because they don't spend time with us daily. A brother or sister's love can be less conspicuous, as the young girl in Who Loves Me? notes, but it is there regardless of whether it's plainly stated. Siblings are part of the bedrock of one another's lives, so there's no escaping the truth that they would be missed if they were taken away, even if they get on each other's nerves more than they get along. Friends quarrel, too, perhaps leaving them to wonder if they really love each other, but the welcome sanctuary of close friendship cannot be undone by cross words, or selfish or unkind acts. Friendship is still love even when you're at odds, and its rewards are well worth the interludes of discord and hurt feelings. If you don't let yourself lose sight of the fact that you love and need each other, no rift is beyond reconciliation. All you need is love. \\n Patricia MacLachlan's soothing words will set at ease the minds of readers who fret that they aren't loved, and need a calming voice to reinforce that they are. The specific examples in this book won't apply to everyone, but they'll jumpstart readers' brains to come up with their own proofs of love. Who Loves Me? accomplishes this purpose with sweetness and style, and I might well give it two and a half stars. In addition to her award-winning junior novels, Patricia MacLachlan has fashioned an outstanding career writing high-quality picture books, and Who Loves Me? is yet another sound effort. I fondly recommend it.\", 'Cute little story...beautiful illustrations, a nice touch for a chapter book.', \"A beautifully written book that, unfortunately, won't get read. This book has yet to be checked out of my library. And once I read it, I can see why. The setting is difficult to grasp (time? place?) and the switching narrations between the fox and human were confusing.

I learned a lot of interesting trivia type information and thought about under clothes in a way I never had before. In a way this book could be used as an introduction to anthropological research, using artifacts and information about them to tell us about the culture and society of past people.

For instance, when the dandelions become silver, we are told to look to the north as that is when wolf pups are being born. While the reader may be unfamiliar with the tundra, he will be familiar with when dandelions seed in his area. It's an effective literary device. \\n The illustrations included are nice.

I'm guessing that many readers will love the idea of Barkus finding his own pet, a kitten named Baby, and how they fit seamlessly into the family's lifestyle. It will be interesting to see in what direction this new animal series will go. I find it quite useful as a read aloud, as will anyone who loves animals at all.

It's easy to set aside old books for shiny new ones, but there's something to be said about a fantastic story, no matter if it's old or new. I met Sharon Creech this year, ate lunch with her at the Andersons YA Literature conference and realized I had not read but one or two of her many wonderful novels. My fifth grade teachers teach this book every year as well. So I picked it up on audio when I ran out of my latest selection of audiobooks and put it on the top of the pile.

This whole novel is crafted in such a way that makes you ache for more of the story and to ache for the girl who is narrating it. Walk Two Moons hit me from behind. A completely unexpected turn of events, a story that is both funny and sad, and a timeless tale that will never lose its voice. It definitely deserves the Newbery and makes me want to go and pick up more of Creech's books as soon as I can.

They spend much of their time moving around and trying not to be noticed. The boy relates to a bird that is trapped inside, until it finds a way to fly outside. The story is written from the boy's point of view, and it's very tough to think about children in these circumstances. But sadly, this is the reality for many kids. This book could be a great conversation starter, and an awesome book to help talk about point-of-view. It would be interesting to consider how the story would be different if it were written from the father's point-of-view. Even though this book was written about families living in the airport before the terrorist attacks of 9-11-01 occurred, I think kids will be able to understand and relate to this story.\", 'I had the honor of reading the Princess Fables to my children for bedtime this past week.

A fun way to introduce or enrich lessons on nocturnal versus diurnal animals, animal adaptations, and months and seasons, as well as offering opportunities to compare/contrast.

As a result I was eyeballing her reading record and due to one particular entry started remembering about some of the Disney books that I had read as a younger reader. \\n Although this isn't a direct take from her reading feed this is one that popped into my minds while it was so memorable to me due to the illustrations, especially when it came to the dragon who seems to reach pages on end. As a result I was happy to find a digital copy of this old book and to once more be able to study the illustrations. Lord Gurr reminds me in both personality and looks like some of those people that I have struggled with in life that is isn't hard to see him as a villain although with some of the facial features it makes me wonder if there was a bit of stereotyping while his poor bulldog has the most sad expression on all the pages that he is shown in that it makes you feel pity for him since he just seems an add-on for decoration purposes. \\n The dragon who is shown on the cover is such a minor character, which is a shame but his face normally has a weird gaze on it while Minnie herself hasn't been drawn in her best. Otherwise even for its age the drawings are brightly colored while offering the reader with some fun appearances that add to the timeframe for the story. \\n The writing is simple and easy but at the same time a bit long for beginning readers so this would be more or less a recommend to elementary children who may enjoy a bit of an older fairytale version provided by the world of Disney.\", \"Loosely based on the actual migration of orchard orioles who fly each year back and forth from the northeastern part of the United States to Central America, this picture book follow the maiden flight of two birds.

The protagonists, Siri and Erik, are written to be the kind of perfect Caucasian children that never fight or quarrel, rarely misbehave, and routinely end up as the paragons of virtue and selflessness -- quite contrary to how, you know, ACTUAL children act. There are no unhappy endings here; all conflicts are neatly (and easily) resolved with a combination of farce, basic problem solving, or Deus Ex Machina. Even worse, Bedstafar\\'s attempts at Viking history lessons end up being written at a level past the attention span of your average 2nd grader; my daughter frequently sighed or asked me to \"skip ahead a bit\" when we got to the lengthy descriptions of Viking life, culture, and artifacts. Overall, when asked how she liked this book, my seven-year old, who is one who does appreciate wit, whimsy, and the novelty of a well-written children\\'s book, said \"It was just okay.\" Me too, honey.', 'Another one of my favorites from childhood.', 'Gryphon press offers a variety of humane education picture books that are beautifully illustrated, professionally presented, and which are gentle enough so as not to scare off mainstream readers. \\n Rabbits are the third most popular pet in America and are also the third most common animal surrendered to animal shelters.

Chances are, we have all seen rabbits in this sad situation. Thankfully, this bunny is rescued by a woman who knows the proper way to care for rabbits, and they end the story on a happy note. \\n The book concludes with a note to parents about the reality of rabbit care, and offers websites for more information.', 'It was an awesome book !!!', \"This one is very, very short but I actually laughed quite a lot, reading this from an adult's perspective.

I\\'ve always loved the land of Oz growing up and the different spins different authors and directors have put on this classic novel, so I figured I\\'d finally read it myself. And I was not disappointed. \\n Spoilers- Well if you\\'ve seen the movies, you\\'ve pretty much read the book. NOT to say that seeing the movie is EVER really better than reading the book, but I mean as far as spoilers go, the movies I\\'ve seen have included various aspects of the original book so you already know what will happen. Which kind of sucks because I wasn\\'t like surprised when anything happened, but was also kind of great because that means the movie adaptations were faithful! Which is what a book nerd likes to hear. That being said, I still really enjoyed reading it. I wanted to read it just to finally be able to say I\\'ve read it and because tomorrow is Halloween and I\\'m dressing up as Dorothy, and I\\'d feel like a fraud if I hadn\\'t read the book yet. I also really enjoyed this because it helped my knowledge for one of my all time favorite series and one of my 2014 favorites: Dorothy Must Die. A series where Dorothy has returned to Oz and with the help of Glinda and her friends, quickly becomes and evil tyrant of Oz. It was pretty amazing and I suggest it to everyone! Especially readers of the original. \\n Some of my favorite lines were: \\n Pg. 56 People with Hearts \\n \"I shall take the heart,\\' returned the Tin Woodman; \\'for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world\" pg. 47 \\n \"You people with hearts,\\' he said, \\'have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, so I must be very careful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn\\'t mind so much.\" Pg. 56 \\n I just thought this were really cool and thought provoking. \\n Overall, really great and glad I read it. ;D', 'Highly entertaining and interactive book for children, teaching them about colors.

It's a post-Guardians of the Galaxy baby Groot, and it's not too long before Rocket pulls him into another adventure. \\n The genuis of Night Night, Groot isn't just that it's a book with some truly adorable illustrations. It's also a book that makes the Marvel universe accessible to a younger crowd, particularly for those readers that may not necessarily be ready for the movies just yet. \\n (Because after all, who wants to be the young reader who doesn't know what the Marvel universe is, especially if all of their friends are talking about it?) \\n Deneen carefully walks readers through a fun landscape adventure, where readers and baby Groot encounter a number of familiar Marvel faces.

The illustrations are Disney ones, not classic Pooh illustrations. The nursery rhymes have only one verse, with a few having more detailed verses.

And when you're using a beloved character with still shot illustrations (snapshots taken from other book illustrations), why not use the original illustrator's work?

With the help of her grandfather, she puts it in a jar in a box and adds food and decorations so that it is surrounded by beauty as it grows. Since she has an up close perspective on how it is changing, she is able to watch its metamorphosis into a butterfly. Naturally, it is hard for her to release it back into nature, but she knows that she must do so. The years pass, and the girl becomes a woman whose garden is always filled with butterflies of the same kind that she once befriended. Could it be that they are the offspring of that first butterfly? Not only does this picture book contain wonderfully descriptive language [\"I made a curve of rainbow / like a hug / to keep her safe\" (unpaged) and \"She was a butterfly, / all spotted, orange, black, and brown / as if someone had shaken paints / and let the drops fall down\" (unpaged)], but it also provides directions for how to raise a butterfly. Of course, the book would be perfect for anyone teaching a science lesson on the life cycle of the butterfly and anyone interested in intergenerational stories. The text is simply eloquent and almost magical--there are no other words that do it justice--and the illustrations, created in gouache, are incredibly impressive for their colors and softness. The love the narrator has for this butterfly and the affection shared between a grandfather and a granddaughter fills the pages.', 'What a beautiful story about hope and the importance of preserving tradition.', 'A re-read for library book club', 'http://sveta-randomblog.blogspot.com/...', \"I really think I'd give this six stars if I could...\", 'Willow moves in a new neighborhood and helps create a new spirit of neighborliness with her presence.

Esta obra es una seleccion de articulos de la revista para ninos 'La edad de oro', que fue publicada mensualmente en los meses de julio a octubre de 1889. \\n Me ha gustado especialmente el articulo 'Musicos, poetas y pintores', en el que el autor senala breves datos biograficos de grandes musicos: como Haendel, Haydn, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Schubert, y Rossini; grandes pintores y escultores: como Miguel Angel, Rafael, Leonardo da Vinci (tambien gran matematico, arquitecto, ingeniero, y musico), Guercino, y Tintoretto; y grandes poetas y escritores: como Dante, Metastasio, Goldoni, Alfieri, Cervantes, Wieland, Schiller, Goethe, Koerner (autor de 'El canto de la espada'), Tomas Moore, Lope de Vega, Calderon, Moliere, Voltaire, Kotzebue, Victor Hugo, Congreve, Shakespeare, Milton, Alexander Pope, Chatterton, Robert Burns, Keats, Percy Shelley, Byron, Coleridge, Lytton, Barrett Browning, Tennyson, George Crabbe, Wordsworth, y Walter Scott (yo no conocia muchos de ellos). \\n Otro de los articulos que me ha gustado es 'Padre las Casas', en el que el autor hace una pequena biografia sobre el sacerdote espanol Bartolome de las Casas, y en el que destaco el siguiente parrafo: 'El hombre virtuoso debe ser fuerte de animo, y no tenerle miedo a la soledad, ni esperar a que los demas le ayuden, porque estara siempre solo: !pero con la alegria de obrar bien, que se parece al cielo de la manana en claridad!'. \\n Me gusta la sensibilidad que transmite Jose Marti en cualquiera de sus textos, aunque a veces me resulta un poco costoso tambien seguir sus frases, que son muy largas.

His only friends are Bob, a homeless dog who shares his \"domain\" and Stella, a wise, old elephant. Told from Ivan\\'s point of view, the writing is appropriately spare, the words simple. That proves to be a double-edged sword, however. While the writing style suits Ivan\\'s voice, its simplicity masks the complexity of the story it is trying to tell and obscures the nuances of the characters. An attentive adult reader will be able to infer the shades of Mack\\'s character, George\\'s internal struggle, the illegality of what is done to Ivan, the imperfections of zoos etc., but the younger readers the story is intended for may not pick up on all of those things. I did like how humans were both the destructors and the \"saviors\" (although of course Ivan has a lot of agency in his own saving) in the story, giving it more balance than the first few chapters would suggest. With all of the zoo horror stories I\\'ve read the last year, the ending comes out a little more strongly pro-zoo than I\\'m comfortable with, but it\\'s a realistic happy ending, and does come balanced with a few bittersweet notes.', \"I liked the inner dialogue showing Suzy's anguish (reminded me of Wintergirls), the science references in a book geared for girls (The Fourteenth Goldfish, anyone?), and the hint of Aspergers coming from the pages (Rain Reign or any of the myriad other titles showing up on shelves recently).

It is one of a series of books, Scientists in the Field. The main goal of sharing Dennis Kunel's experiences is to interest children in science, to inform them of the possibilities, and to inspire some to perhaps become scientists themselves. \\n Many of Kunkel's full color photographs enliven the text. The captions identify the kind of microscope used and include the magnification, which is all explained within. Kunkel's speciality, something that surprised me, seems to be expertise with microscopes, so his subjects, and therefore his projects, are diverse, including insects, pollen, blood cells, muscle cells, molds, blades of grass and more. The first chapter, Becoming a Scientist explains his personal journey. The next chapter, Working as a Scientist, highlights representative experiences of Kunkel's, such as investigating the reemergence of life in lakes and streams in the blast area after the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Kunkel appears to have a lot of autonomy about what projects to pursue and, I assume, who to work with - that appealed to me! The chapter Magnifying Mosquitoes is also where the author explains Kunkel's methods and equipment, from the loupe to the transmission electron microscope. The book ends with Kunkel's advise on How to Become a Scientist.

Let me count the ways: (Sorry, Shakespeare) \\n Potent storytelling- compelling me to turn page after page. \\n Language that captures unique and distinct voices for characters you'll never meet in any other books. \\n Story-within-a-story-within-a-philosophical question, layered in ways it can and should be read and discussed across generations and decades. \\n Anchored in a time and place so real I would recognize it if I saw it, yet true for any place and time. \\n Deep themes and questions regarding war, trauma, PTSD, and personal values explored with depth and dignity. \\n Add to that: My years working in wildlife rehabilitation make me both intrigued by and skeptical of stories with wild animal characters. In this case, the specificity of species patterns and behaviors ring true and allow the fox characters to reveal their most natural selves, as far as humans could tell. Pennypacker allows readers to come away with heightened respect for the intelligence and heart of these creatures without resorting to anthropomorphizing or maudlin sentiment. \\n Read this. Share it. Talk out it. Please.\", \"I received a digital copy of this title from the publisher via Netgalley. \\n Ten Second Synopsis: \\n Use the rhymes to aid you in hunting for Bigfoot in the illustrations, while learning some information about the Bigfoot legend along the way. \\n This is a fun, fully illustrated Bigfoot adventure that allows the reader to decipher clues as to where Bigfoot might be lurking. I will admit to being overly excited at the thought of an book that touted itself as an interactive Bigfoot hunting experience and it was these expectations that possibly led to me being a little disappointed with the interactivity of the story. \\n Essentially, this is a search-and-find style of book, with clues given in the rhyming text as to where to search for Bigfoot in the (admittedly pretty impressive) illustrations. Some of the rhymes aren't that flash to be honest, but the illustrator has definitely gone next-level serious on making sure Bigfoot won't be found after a simple cursory glance at the page. The book also includes some extra Bigfoot-related things to find at the end of the book (scat, for instance), so readers can extend their searching pleasure by going back through the illustrations to look for things they missed the first time. \\n Overall, I think kids will probably love this book and find plenty to occupy their time and imagination.\", 'Review to follow!', \"29 September 2009 \\n I'd forgotten just how good this on is.

The principal's son got Ray kicked off the wrestling team, gives Dutch wedgies and steals his homework, and treated Pearl, his ex-girlfriend, very rudely. They'll be motivated to help us.

The book wasn't amazingly written, but I found myself gently sucked into the plot. The pranks were creative and believable. From the cute girl, to the nerd, to the big lug everyone assumes is dumb, they combined their talents and stories to create an unlikely team. I guess I enjoy cheering for underdogs which really fit this situation. The author did a great job of making me detest the principal and his son, so that helped develop the emotional impact of the conflict. The love between Perk, Tommy, and Adam was evident.

Grady (12), Emily (16) and their two scientist parents move down to Florida so that Grady\\'s dad\\'s can do some experiments with 6 swamp deer he has. I looked up swamp deer on Wikipedia. They really do exist. But Stine claims they\\'re from South America and Wiki says they\\'re only found in India and are called Barasingha. They are cute. :) \\n When Emily and Grady decide to explore the swamp a little (Grady in shorts and sandals - moron move right there) they discover a small, crude wooden shack. And there is a swamp hermit living in the shack! With \"amazing\" black eyes and grey-white hair pulled back in a ponytail, he\\'s an intimidating figure. Emily and Grady flee instead of introducing themselves. \\n Grady makes two friends about his age - Will and Cassie. Cassie is convinced that the swamp hermit is a werewolf. Will is skeptical. But he does tell Grady why it\\'s called Fever Swamp. A hundred years ago, everyone who had been in the swamp developed a horrible fever that killed most of them. The ones it didn\\'t kill went crazy. \\n Grady promptly comes down with a fever the next day. He starts hearing howling from the swamp every night. Other nights he and his sister hear scratching at the door. But when they open it, nothing\\'s there. \\n A few days later a gigantic 100-pound dog appears. He\\'s super-friendly and very affectionate with Grady. He has very blue eyes. Grady convinces his parents to keep the dog, which he names Wolf. Then animals start getting brutally killed... \\n ... \\n Will and Grady explore the swamp with Wolf. Wolf has to be let out every night because if he isn\\'t, he goes crazy and wrecks the house. Emily and the parents suspect Wolf is the one killing all the animals. (I knew this wasn\\'t true because he\\'s still eating all the dog food Grady is feeding him.) Ed Warner, a neighbor, goes into the swamp to hunt turkey and never returns. Cassie is convinced the swamp hermit is the werewolf and he killed the animals and Mr. Warner. The swamp hermit chases the kids screaming \"I\\'m the werewolf! I\\'m the werewolf!\" But then he says he\\'s just kidding.

Who is the werewolf? Is there even a werewolf? What or who is killing the animals? At one point I was seriously convinced Grady\\'s parents were werewolves. \\n Stine\\'s description of Florida and the swamps are excellent and a joy to read.

The 'Drina' books were a favourite of mine growing up - in fact they were a favourite of my mother as well, as they were first published in 1957. \\n The series consists of eleven books, detailing the life and adventures of Drina Adams from age ten (roughly) to age eighteen. Drina, brought up by her grandparents - soft and gentle grandfather and strict and over bearing granny - after her parents were killed when she was only 18 months old. Drina is desperate to be a ballet dancer, but her granny is determined that she have nothing to do with the world. However Drina does eventually win, and we learn more about her past, her legacy, her legendary ballet dancer mother, and her travels around the world - as well as her learning to be a ballet dancer - throughout the series. \\n The series has aged remarkably well - particularly considering I'm reading them over half a century since the first books graced the shelves. Yes there are subtle differences - no mobiles, no computers, there are still corridors and compartments in trains and telegrams. But these are so well blended that it doesn't seem jarring. \\n Yes there are turns of phrase that are awkward, and the editing is a bit naff in some of the books, but overall they are a lovely series - one that translates well from child to adult. \\n Drina is - whilst at times a little too highly strong - a mostly lovely character. I felt for her, and ached for her, and raced through the pages to see what would happen to the charming heroine next. \\n The secondary characters sometimes fall into stereotypes, but they're so vividly created and delightful to get to know - apart from the nasty ones which \\n I want to throw things out - that it really didn't bother me. And Drina seems to have no problem making friends, which lead to a vast cast of well-crafted individuals with compelling backstories - Jenny and her tragic time growing up, the refugee Ilonka, born and bred Londoner Rose. Oh and not forgetting the boys - flamboyant Paris born Igor Dominick the younger, and the fabulously dreamy Grant Rossiter... \\n After reading them again, I think I've discovered where I got my early yearning to travel, because almost every country Drina visits is one on my list of places I'm desperate to visit. Wales, Switzerland, the Chilterns, Italy, Edinburgh, New York, Paris, Madeira... And every single one of them exquisitely and vividly described. \\n And the romance... It's subtle, and completely different from anything we experience in modern novels. There is no epic first kiss, and for the most part it is a long distance yearning, but it's beautiful and it's painful and it's exquisite when they're together. \\n And whilst Drina's life seems at times a little charmed, there are hardships in there, it isn't all beautiful awesome, and her journey is by no means an easy road, and I think that gives the series such a good believable grounding to branch off into fiction from. \\n The ballet is not all consuming, but plays a very great part, and completely takes over whilst your reading. I always find myself yearning to travel and take up ballet whilst reading the books - which I always take as a good sign if it makes me long to do something I wouldn't normally do. \\n My only complaint was how quickly Drina falls in love, and sometimes how harsh and over bearing her Grandmother can be. \\n Whilst there are always favourite books in a series, overall it creates a very beautiful telling of an extraordinary child's early life.\", '* I voluntarily reviewed an ARC of this book* \\n My son and I are reading this series as part of a December challenge. We both really liked when Izzy got to fly and see her family again. This is a cute little story that young kids will enjoy.', '2.5 stars', \"Have you ever been on a roadtrip that seemed like it would never end? Well, at least there was a road to travel down and places to stop and get food. No such luck for this boy. He is stuck on a boat in the middle of nowhere with no land in sight, with only a bear who is probably lost and possibly completely insane. 'I spy' gets boring pretty quickly when the only things to see are the sea and the sky, and the only comic book on board isn't even in English. Through monster attacks and ghost ships, things look pretty bad for the boy and the bear. But despite it all they keep sailing to horizons unknown. \\n This book is like a cheerier, children's version of Waiting for Godot. Its title describes the contents of the book well. The novel starts with the boy boarding a boat with a bear for a captain and that's the way things stay for most of the novel. There's an occasional big event, like the monster attack, but for most of the novel nothing happens. And yet, it is absolutely hilarious! The most entertaining thing I've read in a while. Much like Godot the humor stems from the comedic timing of the two leads and the way they play off one another. Much like Godot it is suffused with dramatic irony as the audience increasingly feels that what the leads are waiting for (in this case, arrival at their undisclosed destination) is unlikely to ever arrive. Unlike Godot however the effect is somehow cheerful and ends on an optimistic note. The boy and bear get to know each other and develop a sweet friendship. The complete absurdity of the lovable but incompetent bear prevents things from getting too serious. Then there's the absolutely delightful illustrations drawn by the author that are sure to get a smile. It was the perfect Absurdist novel. The boy and bear are lost without any hope of land (or meaning for their journey) in sight and yet they keep on rowing and facing whatever life throws at them because what other choice do they have? The completely ridiculous nature of their circumstances makes it hard not to laugh even when things are looking grim. This is one of my new favorite books! \\n I'd give this to kids 3rd grade and up looking for a funny story.

All of them return to us for the sequel, seemingly like old friends. It was nice to meet them again! But - wait! New characters? I was a little skeptical, as sometimes new characters are added into slightly poorly thought out series in simply in order to add a dash of something fresh, rather than actually bringing something to the story. (That's not a generalisation, just an observation of some series.) \\n I needn't have worried. In Fleabag #2, as in Webb's other works, each character, scene, sentence and gesture is carefully measured to, not only keep us reading, but to add to the work as a whole. And they're all interesting too - no Mary Sue's here! \\n This sequel felt much darker to me. Gemma's plight isn't one of simply external nature. Greater maturity is needed to understand and to empathise with what is happening. Gemma's possession is quite frightening, and her depression is very moving, so that we almost feel her hopelessness. However, it is still relatable to for young readers, advanced ones at least! \\n I don't want to give anything more away, but Webb takes us on a very exciting ride here!

Heather Zydek introduces the reader to the illuminating beauty of Orthodox Christianity while following Basil through his first year at a new school. Zydek deftly manages to avoid the pitfalls that snag many Christian writers; her characters are normal (not perfect) people who have to grapple with issues ranging from divorce to domestic violence. At the same time, Zydek avoids rushing the reader through one action scene after another, a phenomena that is all too common in young adult literature. Consequently, the pacing is just right.

My review and rating have not been influenced in any way.', 'A cute sequel to the opener in the series, \"The Penderwicks on Gardam Street,\" manages to be a story about a family of coming-of-age girls without it being overly predictable, boring, or corny. All of the family members love and care for one another, and although they never seem to deal with real world issues, and live in a world that doesn\\'t have anything bad happen (maybe upper-middle class heteronormative white world if I may be so bold), the story doesn\\'t become overly pretentious, at least not yet. Keeping in mind of course, it is a book written for children, much of the sisters banning together and becoming a force, is quite endearing, despite the lack of real issues, strife, or worries. To be fair, the main issue within this plot line deals with the death of their mother at a young age to cancer, and I guess my claiming that they don\\'t have issues is not meant to also say that the death of a mom or a parent is too be taken lightly. When I say issues I mean, the girls living on this wonderful street in a glorious suburb, where they can walk to all of their different schools, not worried about anything bad happening to them, and they are also close to this great woods area, and everyone seems to know everyone on the block and everyone knows everyone, and high school boys playing football will acknowledge them, and when a teenage girl and boy get attacked by a full-grown man they are fine, actually dominate him, and the full grown man is too scared to actually fight back, and they don\\'t just get wrapped Halloween candy, but real homemade cookies from their neighbors(WTF?). Not the childhood I grew up in, and I also grew up in a suburbish area with a white family and middle class lifestyle, but we of course were not the Penderwicks, nor a work of fiction. \\n All of the sisters fall neatly into categories, #1 beautiful and kind (Snow White trope) #2 science genius, #3 creative acting genius, #4 kind to animals, which is okay and has not lead to any boring plot ideas or overdone character tropes...so far. A story meant to be liked, not to challenge, I believe that Jeanne Birdsall has created a great A-list of certain characters in her heroines and the father they so fiercely protect and love. \\n Not my favorite children\\'s series, maybe middle-favorite, if that is an option?', 'On the suggested summer reading list for students.', \"This was silly and lighthearted. I enjoyed the characters' friendships and their adventures. I also read it in Spanish (which was one of my goals for the year).\", \"I thought this story was not fleshed out well. It is a story about Christmas cats who really want to chase rats, but it tells the cats that they shouldn't chase the rats just because they are different...or something like that. The story was a bit hard to follow and kind of seemed to jump from point A to point B with no mention of how things got there. The book did rhyme and that usually keeps my 5 year old's attention, but he told me he was ready to go to sleep before I even finished this one. I also thought the laboratory testing on the rats was a bit weird for a children's book? Overall this story was not really for us.\", \"At first I thought this book is too childish, won't fit my taste. But I keep reading because it's quite enjoyable. And yes it's true. It's enjoyable.

That it started with her being slightly 'abnormal' in the fact that she didn't talk until she was three. Ada Twist was all over the place, wanting to learn, and it was fun to see and to read. The fact that the family was not white was also a pleasant addition to Ada Twist, Scientist. \\n Even though this was a book about a little girl scientist, my favorite line in the book had nothing to do with that. It was simply a portion that talked about how the parents adapted to their curious child and encouraged her, because that's what good parents do. That's what we try to do with our child, even though she's not precisely science minded. Whenever possible, we try to help her explore and be informed. That is what good parents do. It also showed that helping them explore and be informed doesn't mean letting them do whatever they want. Sadly, I think that is a distinction that does actually need to be made for some parents. \\n The verse in Ada Twist, Scientist was fun and easy to read. The illustrations were cute and informative.

He was known primarily for his short stories, which made him famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In fact, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907, when he was only 42. He is still the youngest winner to this day. His most famous work was The Jungle Book, which though many have not read, recognize from Disney's adaptation of it. Today, I am reviewing my favorite Kipling work, his Just So Stories. Groundwood Books produced these books in two beautifully illustrated volumes. \\n Just So Stories, Volume 1 is an 87 page hardcover with illustrations by Ian Wallace. The stories included in this volume are as follows: \\n 1. How the Whale Got His Throat \\n 2. How the Camel Got His Hump \\n 3. How the Rhinoceros Got His Skin \\n 4. How the Leopard Got His Spots \\n 5. The Elephant's Child \\n 6. The Sing-Song of Old Man Kangaroo \\n Just So Stories, Volume 2 is at thicker 139 page hardcover also illustrated by Ian Wallace. The stories included in this volume are as follows: \\n 1. The Beginning of the Armadilloes \\n 2. How the First Letter Was Written \\n 3. How the Alphabet Was Made \\n 4. The Crab The Played with the Sea \\n 5. The Cat That Walked by Himself \\n 6. The Butterfly That Stamped \\n Missing from this collection is The Tabu Tale, which to be fair, is omitted from most British versions. Unlike most of Kipling's works which smack of a very pro-empire view of Britain, these stories are written for children, more specifically Kipling's niece. However, I believe children come in all ages, so even those children in their twenties and thirties will be amused and enlightened by these tales as well. For example, did you know that a whale can only eat small fish, because a whale once swallowed a boy, and that boy built a gate in the whale's throat to prevent it from swallowing big fish and people? Or did you know that a rhinoceros is irritable and has folds in his skin because he got cake crumbs in his skin and as much as he scratched, all he could accomplish was stretching his skin out but not getting rid of the crumbs? \\n The stories that deal with animals are easily the most enjoyable for me and my family, but the ones involving the alphabet proved to be interesting. What really makes these stories though, is the illustrations! The pictures are gorgeous and plentiful! It's always disappointing when children's books don't have many pictures, but they occur in these volumes, about every third page. Most take up the whole page as well, so you and your little ones don't have to squint when reading together. Though these stories are well over 100 years old, they still stand the test of time. So, I encourage you to read them to your kids. If you have adult kids, read them to your grandkids. Make it a family affair, and keep these beautiful stories alive for future generations.\", 'This vibrant picture book plays with color and perspective as well as characters who leave the flat page and enter the real world. The picture is almost finished when one of the chickens in the picture pops her head out. She then stands up and walks over to the paint pots that are waiting to finish the picture. When the chicken peeks into the blue paint, she accidentally tips it over and ends up painting herself. She is joined by a little duckling and then more who splash around in the new blue puddle, turning themselves and the cat who walked past blue. Soon all of the animals are blue. Now what can be done to turn them all back to normal? \\n There is a wonderful playfulness about this title. Even the grumpy animals end up enjoying the escapade. At the same time, there are lots of options to discuss colors, perspective, and art. The book has real depth to it, allowing it to be read just as a cute story, or used more seriously with children. \\n The words are simple and try to stay out of the way, allowing the art to really shine here. And shine it certainly does. It dazzles and glows, inviting young readers into the humor of the book and revealing a magical quality that is lovely. From the freshness of the first spill of the blue to the sogginess and flatness that results, there is an exploration of the media here right on the page. \\n Highly recommended, this is one of my favorite picture books of the year. It is a charming jewel of a picture book that is fun, silly, yet offers plenty to learn. Appropriate for ages 3-6.', 'The joy of having a six-year-old niece who loves to read (and be read to) is that when my sister-in-law finds a particularly cute book for her, I get to read it. This provides me with an excuse if I start to feel too juvenile for my own comfort. At any rate, \"Tuesdays at the Castle\" was one of those cute, light stories, somewhat in the same vein as Diana Wynne Jones\\' \"Howl\\'s Moving Castle\". There were parts of the plot that seemed too simple, even if the story is geared toward young readers; but still, it was a fun read.', 'One of my favorite picture books.

I simply adored this sweet, fun, fast read. Ella and Skyler have been BFFs forever, but with middle school ending, their differences that have always seemed so complimentary now threaten to break their BFF bond. Maybe a BFF Bucket List is just the thing to glue their friendship back together! This charm of a book took me right back to middle school where BFFs are everything. I love the growth of the girls' friendship, and how the author showed how friendships can mature and reemerge in a different place where there's room for everyone to be their growing-up selves. This is a great read for tweens and teens navigating the social landscape of late elementary and middle school, and a fun read for anyone who's shared a half-heart charm necklace with a BFF!\", 'When Mattie Markham and her family move from North Carolina to Pennsylvania to be closer to Mattie\\'s grandmother as she moves into assisted living, Mattie worries that she won\\'t make new friends. She is grateful, therefore, to discover that living next door to her new apartment is a girl her age named Agnes. Agnes, who has an unnamed social disorder accompanied by anxiety, is definitely unusual, but her enthusiasm for life, and her way of making everything feel important and exciting are appealing to Mattie, and the two become close quickly. Unfortunately, though, when school starts up again after Christmas, Mattie discovers that in her new classroom, Agnes is considered the weird kid. Worried about jeopardizing her chances of friendship with her other classmates, Mattie begins to distance herself from Agnes, finding it difficult to reconcile the fun she has with Agnes at home with how strangely she behaves in class. \\n I chose to read Let\\'s Pretend We Never Met solely based on the author, who is a fellow Vassar graduate and the author of the young adult novel, Unbreak My Heart, which I remembered praising in a review a few years ago. Once I learned what the book was about, there was a part of me that was afraid I\\'d just walked into a \"Very Special Friendship\" story a la Stargirl or Wonder, both of which I have found grating. I am so glad to be able to say that this book very clearly is not a message-driven story of the after school special variety, but a much more subtle character-driven novel about the difficulties of navigating fifth grade friendships. \\n All of the characters, from Mattie and her parents, to Agnes and her mom, to Mattie\\'s new teacher and classmates, are believable despite their relative lack of dysfunction. Though there are problems in the story - Mattie\\'s mom\\'s struggle to find full-time work, Mattie\\'s grandmother\\'s signs of dementia, and Agnes\\'s parents\\' marital difficulties - they are the problems of ordinary life, and these difficulties inform each other to give a complete portrait of Mattie as a character and her friendship with Agnes. Unlike Wonder, which essentially exploits Auggie\\'s disfigurement to teach us all how to be tolerant and caring, this book simply delivers that message, quietly and without fanfare, in a way that is powerful without being obnoxious. Walker never reveals Agnes\\'s diagnosis and instead defines her by her unique interests, her personality, and her behaviors, both the usual and unusual ones. \\n I don\\'t keep up with many new middle grade books now that I\\'ve mostly stepped out of the library world. Knowing that I\\'m only going to read a few this year, I\\'m glad Let\\'s Pretend We Never Met is one that happened to come across my radar. It\\'s a book I would have loved as a kid, and one that I would absolutely feel comfortable having my own girls read in a few years. The writing is good, the characters feel real, the moral is clear but not preachy, and it is enjoyable to read. \\n This review also appears on my blog, Read-at-Home Mom.', \"This book was so strange and fast. It was too simple, and lacked development. I really appreciate the illustrator's work throughout the entire book.

In fact, it only recently came to mind within the past year and then after signing up for the Flashback Challenge I thought there wasn't a more appropriate book to be included in my list. You see, Foxy is the only book that I remember reading as a child that was both a book on grade level and one that stayed with me emotionally for over twenty years. \\n Most of my childhood reads blur together. I was a voracious reader and devourer of books and never thought once to keep a list (which is surprising because I've always been list maker). Foxy, I believe, was the first book that I cried over. \\n As an adult, I shy away from books where the main characters or main plot devices are animals. I cannot stomach an animal dying or being abused, in books or films. When I watched Jaws, I always rooted for the dog in the ocean to survive, not the person. I've never seen Benji, Lassie, or Old Yeller. Nor have I read Where the Red Fern Grows, Old Yeller, or Cujo. I believe strongly that books should put some sort of warning label when an animal is viciously abused or dies. Marley & Me? Nope. Won't ever read it, regardless of all its hype. \\n You can probably guess where that paragraph is taking me, right? Foxy is about a dog (who looks like a fox). An abandoned dog. An abused, starving, abandoned dog. Luckily Foxy gets rescued in the beginning of the story by Jeff, a young boy who is camping in the Keys with his folks. But, because there has to be conflict, enter Amber. Amber is daughter of the campground owners and geez louise is she one obnoxious bratty little girl. Really. Like, someone needs a spanking troubled girl. She decides that she wants Foxy for herself and manages to cause more physical and emotional misery to the dog and Jeff that I began to wonder if she was the spawn of Satan or something. \\n This book is discontinued and I just so happened to find it on Bookmooch. It's a quick read and still invoked the same tormented images in my mind as it did as a child. I think I'll stick to my rule of not reading books with animals in it.

Goodnight, Sleep Tight: What a Wonderful Flight by Louise Lintvelt does a great job making the idea of bedtime an entertaining one.

The fun rhymes, sound effects, and repetitive phrases make this book an enjoyable read time and again. \\n The illustrator, Do Thai Thanh, has made these adventurous aircraft look friendly and fun-loving. My daughter likes to point out the big eyes on each one. I\\'m amused by the pictures of the aircraft sleeping; one is dreaming, one is cuddling with a teddy bear, one has his blanky, etc...Also, there is a clever use of color by the illustrator to clearly distinguish between daytime and nighttime. \\n My two year old rarely sits through an entire reading of a picture book, but something about this book (probably all of the above) holds her attention until the last page every night we read it. I think her favorite character is Jane the Jet Plane.

Fliegen zum Beispiel.\" Was Kos stattdessen gerade erlebt, gleicht eher einer Bruchlandung: der Herzinfarkt seines Vaters, der mehr ist als sein bester Freund, drei starrkopfige Schwestern, mit denen er das Familienhotel am Laufen halten muss. Und dann ist da noch Isabel - die hat er immer noch nicht gekusst. Er brauchte dringend Auftrieb. Aber im Moment sieht es nicht danach aus ... (Quelle: Verlag) \\n Meine Meinung: Hatte ich das Buch in der Buchhandlung gesehen hatte ich es wahrscheinlich nicht mitgenommen. Es hatte mich zwar von aussen total angesprochen aber so durch und durch Contemporary Bucher schrecken mich doch immer ein bisschen ab. Glucklicherweise hat es mir der Thienemann Verlag aber in einer netten Mail schmackhaft gemacht und letztendlich bin ich froh, dass sie genau das getan haben. \\n Musste ich das Buch empfehlen wurde ich geraderaus sagen: Allen denen, die Wunder geliebt haben. Das ist zwar sehr hoch gestochen, wenn man bedenkt, wie viel Einfluss dieses Buch auf viele seiner Leser genommen hat. Dennoch gleicht Erst wirst du verruckt und dann ein Schmetterling Wunder in mancherlei Hinsicht. Es geht um einen Jungen, der ankommt, seinen Weg findet, Probleme bewaltigen muss und so erwachsen wird. In diesem Fall unterscheiden sich beide Bucher nicht. Genauso wenig wie in den Schreibstilen die beide ganz toll, super gut lesbar sind und obendrauf noch super den Gefuhlszustand von Jungs ruberbringen. Kos ist erst 13 und da er seine Geschichte per Kassette aufzeichnet spricht er frei und geraderaus sehr ungezwungen von seinen Erlebnissen. Dadurch entsteht eine ganz eigene und absolut erfrischende Erzahlweise denn Kos hat diese Art alles geradeheraus zu sagen und auf sehr lustige Weise uber alles, was ihm passiert nachzudenken. \\n Kos Leben selbst kann gerade nicht besser laufen. Ihm geht es gut, er ist glucklich. Er fuhrt ein entspanntes Leben mit seinen drei Schwestern und seinem Vater im Hotel Grosse L, ist richtig gut im Fussball und konnte sogar bald von einem Talentescout von Ajax entdeckt werden und noch dazu verfolgt seine grosse Liebe Isabel jedes seiner Spiele, da auch ihr Bruder in der Mannschaft spielt. Doch genau dann, als er den entscheidenden Elfmeter schiesst, verandert sich alles in seinem Leben. Denn genau in diesem Moment hat sein Vater einen Herzinfarkt und muss ins Krankenhaus. Nun mussen die vier Geschwister das Hotel alleine fuhren und ware der Koch Walput nicht schon verruckt genug, bringen seine drei Schwestern noch allerlei Schwung ins Haus. Die sind namlich alles andere als normal und wahrend die 19-jahrige Libbie noch am normalsten erscheint aber heftig verliebt ist, bringt die 15-jahrige Briek mit ihrer pubertaren Art alle schnell auf die Palme und die kleine Pel (mein kleiner Favorit) brachte mich wahrend des Lesens mit ihrer verruckten und tierlieben Art immer zum Lachen. Alle Charaktere des Buches sind durchweg so liebevoll gestaltet und letztendlich genauso suss und einzigartig, wie der Rest des Buches. \\n Letztendlich ist das was am Ende bleibt ein ganz einzigartiges Buch. Es ist nicht uberladen mit Spannung. Die Handlung platschert so vor sich hin. Das hat jedoch nicht gestort denn das Buch begeistert durch Kos liebevolle und absolut lustige Art, den wohl unvergesslichsten Mai aller Zeiten zu beschreiben. Es ist kein Buch, was Spannung braucht. Es lasst den Leser lachen aber gleichermassen auch durch tiefgrundige Stellen nachdenken. Es zeigt den Weg eines Jungen, der ins kalte Wasser geschmissen wird und so schnell aber erfolgreich lernen muss, selbststandig und vor allen Dingen er selbst zu sein. Diese wichtige Botschaft vermittelt der Autor Sjoerd Kuyper auf gerade mal 250 Seiten auf eine so wundervolle Weise, dass ich jede einzelne Seite des Buches genossen habe. \\n Bewertung: Erst wirst du verruckt und dann ein Schmetterling ist genauso einzigartig wie sein Titel. Verglichen mit Wunder und Wir wollten alles, wir wollten nichts ist dieses Buch eines der wenigen Jugendbucher, die neben Unterhaltung noch tiefer gehen und den Leser, egal ob jung oder alt, nachdenklich werden lassen. Ausserdem punkten die vielen lustigen Stellen und naturlich die tollen Charaktere, allen voran Pel, die mir ein kurzweiliges Lesevergnugen beschert haben. Was das L in Hotel Grosse L fur euch bedeutet musst ihr selbst erforschen. Fur mich bedeutet es jedenfalls Lesespass und Liebe! So kann ich diesem Buch guten Gewissens 5 von 5 Fuchschen geben. \\n Vielen herzlichen Dank an den Gabriel Verlag, fur das tolle *Rezensionsexemplar.', 'Ca cuon sach la nhung buc thu qua lai cua 2 dua tre rat than nhau nhung 1 dua phai chuyen den thanh pho khac do gia dinh. \\n Nhung buc thu tu 2 thanh pho - tan do va co do cua Tho Nhi Ky - Istanbul va Alcara ve chuyen hoc hanh, gia dinh va nhieu thu linh tinh khac; moi thu deu duoc hai dua be tam su cho nhau rat ngay ngo, cham biem va doi luc cung tinh cam kieu tre con. \\n Khong hieu bang cach ky dieu nao ma Azit Nesin co the nhap vai hoan hao den vay, hay doc sach de nhin moi thu don gian hon, thoai mai hon, song tinh cam hon mot cach tu nhien chu khong phai la \"36 ke de giup suy nghi tich cuc hon\" :) \\n Cuon nay bo minh mua tu hoi minh tieu hoc, minh da doc khong biet bao nhieu lan roi nhung moi lan ve nha van thinh thoang doc lai vai chuyen, quyen nay se khong bao gio xa tu sach cua bo minh, va tuong lai se la cua minh :)', '3.5/5', \"Ten days in the hospital under observation for a possible concussion?

A lush, clean, modern take on the ABC through the exotic natural world - both in the backyard and the world over - this anthropological book became an instant favorite for my family. A far cry from the \"A is for apple\" and \"C is for cats\" books I grew up with, the photographed fruits, geodes, tentacles, gold, wild goods and found objects are exciting, seemingly touchable and meaningful; and the author guides her readers through pages with Mary Poppins-like magic and a wise understanding of her subjects, both the ones on the page and the ones reading the page. \\n Rachel Garahan has an eye for wild beauty and knows how to make \"the familiar unfamiliar and the unfamiliar familiar.\" Her ability to make curious, elemental connection between us and our natural world is deep and delicious.

I too grew up in a house with an attorney father who liked to argue. Luckily, I had a brother who did most of the arguing back. The tone was irreverent, which was enjoyable, and a little refreshing after the last two overly religious novels. \\n Content-wise it\\'s probably the most YA Newbery winner up to this point. There was even one spot, I could see a parent complaining about if I sent it home with a student. (There was a song on one of Dave\\'s records about the birds and the bees.)

It defines the concept and has many examples as well as the purpose of synonyms. The book has few words per page and colorful, humorous and related pictures just like a good picture book. The pictures are very illustrative for a child trying to understand meaning. But it most definitely increases vocabulary and introduces kids to what language can do. This is illustrated in the passage, \"They give us alternatives, substitutes, choices and help give our stories more interesting voices.\" To further underline the instructive quality, the words that are synonyms are in colorful text as opposed to the basic black of the rest of the words. Overall this is an effective book in being both instuctional and entertaining. \\n Critical Reviews \\n Kirkus \\n Kirkus highly recommends this book for the classroom. It also highlights many of the aspects that I found notable such as the colorful synonyms, entertainment and context clues from illustrations.

And this book is my first YA kind, at first the cover impressed me and after reading the description, i felt confident enough to try it and I\\'m glad i did it. It\\'s very different from the conventional varieties of it. I could feel some pretty inspirations as well as pretty much enthusiasm from Carl Sagan, Antoine de saint Exupery, Elon Musk and many oblivious people. \\n The story went real nice that i felt confident enough about the well-being of the characters right from the beginning even though some odds are thrown by the author for the suspense. The background of the characters and events are so rich in experience and provided so much easiness in reading. \\n However I felt the experience was richer in the first half of the book. The kid, Alex Petrovski \"recording the events in his ipod\" style narration is very very nice to read and considerably affected by the kid\\'s perspective of Innocent wisdom. The philosophical - inferential part deserves much appreciation referring the contexts of science as a sheer source of spirituality. Not much science in the plot, only the philosophical understandings from sentient perspective. So people with diverse interests can find it comfortable to read especially people who don\\'t give a thing about science. \\n Few of my favorite lines, \\n \"Do you think there are intelligent beings out there in the cosmos who don\\'t have sadness?\" \\n \"I looked out the window again and we were even higher, and I couldn\\'t tell where the roads and buildings were anymore and it was just like my hero said, that from a certain height you can\\'t even tell there\\'s intelligent life on our own planet. \\n So if you guys come to Earth, make sure you look closely enough.\" \\n Overall it\\'s the kind of book which you can gift to your middle grade kids and shall also be read by yourselves for pretty much soothing and relaxing break time read presuming you\\'ve already come through a lot of science stuffs; If not, it could be revelational for you as well.

Now I found it all a bit silly, with all the mentions of the \"simple\" people of the area and their consequently more moving religious faith. And Grizel not being as deeply involved as the others because of her \"hardness\". \\n Joey also intervenes in order to encourage the engagement of Juliet and Donal (a young Irish man who has jilted her at the beginning of the story - although it appears that it is his sister Kay whom Juliet had a true affection for). I find this a bit irritating - Donal has dumped Juliet because his sister doesn\\'t think Juliet\\'s family is good enough for him, then after a talking to by Joey, he takes her back. Juliet is quite delighted over all this, of course, despite his previous behaviour - I think I found this more touching when I was younger too! \\n Oh, and then there\\'s the ridiculous adoption of little Irish Biddy by the Guides company, and the musings that perhaps they could train her as a maid for the Robin, or maybe she could be trained as a hairdresser, \"which would suit her well\". Hello snobbery! I saw it pointed out that this is particularly ridiculous after Jo\\'s outrage at Donal & co\\'s snobbery towards Juliet, but this obviously doesn\\'t occur to Brent-Dyer at all. \\n Despite all this, this is one of my favourite books in the series simply because of familiarity, I think. The next few books in the series are ones I haven\\'t read, so I\\'m looking forward to those.', 'I got the sniffles in the bookstore from reading this very sweet story of finding a friend whose weirdness matches your weirdness.', 'A fun look at sleeping customs in a whirlwind trip through the ages, from prehistoric to modern days.

This news is both exciting and bewildering, and Mallory turns to her new diary to help her sort out her feelings and decide what to do. As usual, her decisions are not completely well thought-out, and she winds up owing quite a few apologies, but her heart is in the right place, and she learns yet another valuable lesson about growing up. \\n I love the Mallory books, so I hate to say that this one disappointed me, but it did a little bit. Mainly I'm confused as to why we once again have to revisit the issue of boys and crushes, when just two books ago, in Mallory's Guide to Boys, Brothers, Dads, and Dogs, Mallory determined she wasn't ready to be interested in boys yet. I agree that the subject matter is interesting to girls in the book's target audience, and I loved reading Mallory's secret diary, but it just felt very inconsistent to me, as though I'd missed something in the last couple of books. \\n Another issue is Mary Anne's personality. In the past, she has always been a reliable and level-headed best friend, but in this book she does nothing but egg Mallory on, and encourage her to start a relationship with this boy who supposedly likes her. Half of the mistakes Mallory makes in this book happen at Mary Anne's insistence, which seemed completely out of character for her. \\n I feel like this series is trying to remain relevant as Mallory ages, which is important, because ten-year-olds have different concerns than eight-year-olds, and it makes sense that Mallory's interests will change as she grows up. I like the fact that Mallory is getting older and that she turns to a diary to say things she can't say to anyone else. I kept a journal when I was younger, and I can remember exactly how it felt to sit in my bedroom writing furiously about my first crush. I just hope the Mallory series won't become permanently obsessed with boys. There is lots more to being a girl than pining away for boys, and I like the series best when it focuses on a variety of life experiences and lessons.\", 'Magic might be a trick...or it could be the moments you spend doing something you love?

She's excited about the play that her class will be doing, and decides to try out for Juliet, even though Cassie, a very popular girl, thinks the role should be hers. Maddie has a vivid imagination and an off kilter sense of humor, and she worries that her classmates won't quite get her jokes or share her love of fake mustaches. When the weakness in her arm and leg become bothersome, her mother makes a doctor's appointment for her, but when the symptoms become worse, Maddie ends up in the hospital undergoing an MRI. The verdict-- she has a tumor near her pituitary gland that is causing lots of problems and could potentially impinge upon the optic nerve. An appointment is made for surgery, but Maddie's parents decide to take her and her four brothers to Disney beforehand. Maddie isn't thrilled to tell her classmates, but is encouraged when they send her off with a basket of gifts and cards. Cassie, of course, feels that Maddie should give up her role in the play, especially since Cassie has a crush on the boy playing Romeo, and even goes so far as to voice the opinion that Maddie is making up the tumor in order to get attention! The surgery goes well, but Maddie later has problems with a cyst and has to undergo another surgery. When Maddie returns to school, she has more confidence that her classmates like her, and is able to talk her teacher into presenting Romeo and Juliet with a happier ending. \\n Strengths: This is based on the authors' daughter's similar experience, so there are a lot of good details about what it would be like to deal with this kind of medical experience. How Maddie's absence is handled by her school is a good thing to have in a book, since students do occasionally experience the illness of a classmate. The parents are supportive, the brothers are slightly annoying, and there is a good balance between Maddie's bravery and fear. \\n Weaknesses: A lot of the book was concerned with the play; I know that some schools do more with theater, but books involving theater don't do well in my library. Also, Maddie and her classmates often seemed a little young when they did things like play imaginary games on the playground. This may be because the authors' daughter was nine when she went through the experience, but they wanted to have an older middle grade audience. \\n What I really think: Debating purchase, since my readers do like medical drama but really don't pick up books with theater in them.\", 'I love Jan Thomas and her sense of humor.', '\"Here is my secret.

It is simple for younger children and has good repetition too. I would recommend this book.', 'This book was a little heavier than I expected. Or maybe for a little older audience than I pictured; not sure! But it was definitely enjoyable. The writing style was a little hard to get into in short spurts. I began it multiple times when I only had 10 or 20 minutes. Each time, I couldn\\'t get engrossed. When I finally sat down for a long period of time, I finished it in two sittings. For some reason, I felt as if I needed the time-travelling part explained to me. Maybe because this wasn\\'t as fanciful as something lighter (and younger) like The Borrowers or The Littles. This book took itself much more seriously. So. . . my explanation for the \"episodes\" is that she was a sickly girl, as she says in the book, and these are all dreams or hallucinations while she was sick. \\n That said, I really liked this book! The style reminded me a little bit of Jane Austen. Not sure if that\\'s because it\\'s an \"English\" book, or because of the time, or what, but to me it felt very reminiscent of Jane\\'s style. And I love Jane :) \\n The descriptions in this book are very vivid. It truly is one of those \"lose yourself\" kinds of books in that while I was reading, I felt cold when Penelope was cold, confused or lost when she was, etc. \\n Because I continue to read books that have a lover of books in them, I have to quote this section from the beginning: \"When I was kept at home through illness I pored over many leather-backed books from my father\\'s shelves, and found my own friends in the pages. I read legends and folk-lore, books of poetry and stories of knights in armour, antique tales which had been forgotten and lay thick with dust under piled-up newpapers and periodicals.\" Of course this is where her imagination comes from, and I love that! \\n Here\\'s another part that especially tickled me. In one of her trips back in time, Penelope is being \"tested\" on her ability to read, and the mistress expects her to read English AND Latin. Mistress Foljambe is pleased with her Biblical knowledge, but they have a funny discussion about spelling: \"I remarked on the change of spelling in the same words, and she reasoned with me. \\'Spelling is a matter of individuality,\\' she told me. \\'I have my favourite ways of spelling words, and I choose my letters. My sons and daughters each spell as they wish, and surely you do the same?\\' \\'If I make a mistake I am scolded,\\' said I. She insisted one couldn\\'t make a mistake, for each spelt according to his whim. That was one of the delights of writing, one was free to invent a pretty word, and she was sure I should not be such a dullard as to spell in the same way always. \\'Life would lose one of it\\'s pleasures if we were deprived of the power to write as we wish.\\' . . . This was a new idea for me and I was delighted that I could spell as I pleased and decorate my words as I wished.\" \\n I love this!

Yes, the stories do have Christian themes, but none of them feels forced upon the reader. The stories all have great life lessons for kids, for example: helping your parents clean the house, helping your neighbor rake leaves, helping a classmate carry their book bag, etc.. \\n Overall, The Berenstain Bears: Bedtime Devotional is a cute little book that will easily appeal to younger children. My only complaint is that the book should have also been available in pink for girls.

The story takes some recognizable and well known bits of Norse mythology and expands on the stories to create something new and exciting. this books follows the adventures of children of the Norse gods. they have incredible strength, magical weapons, and monsters for pets. They also have problems with school, bullies, family issues, and attacks by giants. When Asgard, the home of the gods, is threatened with utter destruction it is up to the children of Thor, Sif, Loki, Freya, Balder; and some very special friends, to save it. \\n The Aesir Kids features some high adventure and multifaceted characters that will create interest and excitement. Thrud (the teenage daughter of Thor) has to balance fighting trolls and giants with her after-school job waiting tables at Valhalla. Fire (son of the three mysterious Norns) is out in the world for the first time and has to learn a lot more than school can teach him. Magni and Modi (Thrud's younger brothers) whose strength is matched only by their impulsiveness. Ull is the greatest skier of the gods, that is except for maybe Skade, the four-year-old goddess of skiing. Together with Tjalfi, his sister Roskva, Forsetti, Noss, and Hela (who each have gifts of their own) this special group of godlings need to save thier home, and all the none worlds. It is only by mastering their gifts and trusting in each other that they can defeat Loki and save the universe. This is a fantasy novel based on many actual characters from Norse mythology, and it feels a little like reading some of my favorite classic tales. It's the first published collaboration between author James Grant Goldin and his ten-year-old daughter, Charlotte Goldin. \\n I greatly enjoyed The Aesir Kids. I have always loved reading ancient Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology, and this story felt very true to the tradition. the characters all had their virtues and their faults, and in the end there is an idea of right and wrong that is vindicated. the fact that the author and his daughter worked together to create this story made it even better for me.

How does Isecas the cat fulfill Sahar's dreams and provide her with the self-confidence that Sahar needs to believe in herself? \\n This book contains beautiful digital illustrations that portray the characters' feelings accurately.

Instead of focusing on the worry, it teaches alternatives or ways that you can make a situation better instead of worrying about it. The examples were all very sweet and also dealt with being kind to others and putting yourself in their shoes. For example, the child who was afraid of the first day of school because the new teacher is a bear. Instead of worrying, the books says, imagine that the teacher may be nervous about her first day teaching and bring her a nice jar of honey. I think a lot of children (and parents) can learn from this book! \\n The illustrations for this book are amazing and it would be worth buying the book just for the illustrations alone.

The principal and teachers turn that desire into something fun and rewarding for everyone.

Not every child or adult will be interested in this aspect of Jefferson/s life, but this is a good title to use in conjunction with the Kalman title. \\n One illustration technique of presenting facts in little sidebars or bubbles usually annoys me.

Temporarily giving the girls wings of their own, Ruby escorts them to Fairy Land to meet the King and Queen of the fairies: Oberon and Tatiana. \\n Impressed with the young girls, the King and Queen charge them with the responsibility of finding and freeing the rest of the Rainbow Fairies. These fairies, you see, are being targeted by the evil Jack Frost and with them missing, so too is all the colour of Fairy Land. Kirsty and Rachel must rescue them if Fairy Land is to return to normal. \\n Each book focuses on the finding of a new fairy - Ruby, Amber, Saffron, Fern, Sky, Izzy and Heather - somewhere on Rainspell Island. The books are clearly aimed at a very young, almost 'new reader' audience but is more than your run of the mill 'Jack and Jill go for a picnic, the end' book. Stories, characters and locations carry over somewhat while still maintaining the clear and easy direction of the book: find the fairy, evade Jack Frost. The text was big, clear and easy to read with plenty of illustrations. \\n My only issue with the book was with Jack Frost and his minions. They maintained a constant presence - yet hardly ever managed to actually do any damage.

The problem is the prize she had hoped to gain was not something she wanted; it was to deliver a speech about her town at the first event ever held to celebrate life in Ruby's town.

Ruby wishes she could vanish into thin air. \\n Great Aunt Alice comes to the rescue. Alice is a bit of an eccentric who is rumored to have been a somewhat successful actress way back when.

Has Ruby been able to internalize her Great Aunt's tips in her quest to overcome her fears? How will the big speech go over? \\n This book can be used a guide for anyone, child or adult, who is afraid to speak in public. Ruby's story is in the format of an early chapter book and is an entertaining read for young readers. The author, who was once just like Ruby, is now a public speaking coach. The cast of characters included at the end of the book is a nice little time capsule of acting greats at the beginning of this century and is a bonus for those interested in the theater and the movies.

When Nico returns, Maia fears her new life is too full for him. But, that's not the case.

(When I picked it up I actually thought Nico was going to die, but it turns out he just moves away). The people we love stay with us always, even if they are far away for a while.

Surprisingly, though, when his father overhears his temper tantrum, it turns out that he's shaved off his beard and mustache. As the youngster quickly learns, there's much more to being awesome than just having a beard. This picture book contains a great lesson about self-esteem and being wary of quick-fix schemes, and the illustrations, created with graphite, watercolor, and Adobe Photoshop, add to the humor since readers can see all the trouble to which the boy goes in an effort to be just like his father.

The imaginative scenes never weighed down the plot and I finished the book with a sense of satisfaction. \\n In some ways, this book is like a short film. The plot isn\\'t this long-expansive thing that drones on for ages. The characters are the true stars of the novel. If you or your child goes into it with that perspective, they are sure to not be disappointed. \\n If your looking for another middle-grade novel about sisterhood, I recommend Kira Kira by Cynthia Kadohata.', 'Very cute cumulative tale and a cow and a special friend who just love cookies.

Her parents have lost their family home and, along with it, Lisa's beloved horses. She misses Jupiter the most, but at least the kindly new homeowner, Mr. Pickering, allows Lisa to visit the horses whenever she likes - until his evil nephew, Jimmy, shows up. Lisa is forced to visit the stables under the cover of darkness, for fear of alerting Jimmy. It's becoming clear to Lisa that Jimmy is willing to do anything to keep her away from Mr. Pickering and the horses. Fortunately, for Lisa, a mysterious and beautiful stranger named Angelica arrives to help. \\n What a wonderful story this is! I LOVE books that place girls in strong protagonist roles and Dark Fire certainly does this. Ms. Dorsey has written a story about a young, determined girl who is fearlessly devoted to her friends, family and horses. She's willing to risk anything to right the wrongs she sees. This makes Dark Fire an excellent book for young girls in particular. \\n There's plenty of mystery, action and suspense in this book to keep youngsters involved until the very end. The writing is compelling and intelligent. \\n The idea behind this story is lovely - that there are kind and gentle souls who are watching over horses and their owners is a charming basis for a book series. I've already downloaded another one of Angela Dorsey's books and can't wait to read it! \\n 5 of 5 Stars, Review by Susan Barton, http://diymomblog.blogspot.com\", \"This book is amazing. I couldn't understand about it being a Caldecott winner but it does tell a story with words and pictures. And the story could not move forward without those pictures. It is beautifully drawn.\", 'We had another opportunity to review one of Carole P. Roman\\'s books entitled, \"If You Were Me and Lived In India\". \\n I really love these books. These are a great way to learn about new cultures, places, and to learn about all of this all while reading to your children! \\n Some of the neat things I learned in this book are: \\n 1. There are over one hundred different languages spoken in India. \\n 2. You would call your Mom \"Maaji\" and your Dad would be \"Pitaji\". \\n 3. Cumin, curry, cinnamon, and chilies are used in abundance to flavor the dishes! \\n Another one of the neat features of these books are the Pronunciation guide at the end of each book. \\n I highly recommend this series to anyone who has children, works in a children\\'s library, or works with children. \\n The illustrations are really nicely done and the book is short and to the point. \\n Thank you to the author for providing me a complimentary copy of the book for our review.

Adorable illustrations.', '\"For the duration.\" Looking back from our contemporary vantage point and knowing that World War II lasted four years, it\\'s easy to fall into the the trap of thinking that adherence to gas rationing, conservation of rubber and the enduring of other wartime shortages for four years wasn\\'t all that bad. It must be remembered, though, that Americans and citizens of the other Allied nations had no way of knowing how long the war would last while it was happening. Would it last for a year? Five years? Ten? Fifty? Would the Allies even win the war, ultimately speaking? All of these sobering realities that faced Americans represented uncertainties in their lives, and therefore the concept of buckling down \"For the duration\" was a source of major anxiety, for sure. Especially for a kid as young as Tomie. \\n In For the Duration, the hints from past books of potential trouble between Young Tomie and his older brother begin to come to a head. Tomie\\'s antics have always bothered his brother somewhat, but as Buddy grows older it appears that his tolerance for Tomie is decreasing. His view of Tomie as sort of a sissy gets to be more clearly etched, and the eye rolling and other innocuous gestures of Buddy\\'s mild disapproval from previous books now become more pronounced and worrisome. Buddy refuses to intervene one day in the schoolyard when a group of his friends picks on Young Tomie and calls him a sissy because of the tap dancing shoes that he wears strung across the back of his neck; Buddy steals the key to Tomie\\'s diary and keeps it for more than a week, returning it only after writing unkind things all over the entries that Tomie has so lovingly crafted. The situation with Buddy isn\\'t getting any easier, and the two boys are experiencing all of this strife during the war, when tempers are already thin and people are less comfortable with themselves and others than ever before. \\n Yet Young Tomie finds that even if his brother has turned on him, there are plenty of others who continue to treat him with love for exactly the kind of boy he is. Tomie\\'s grandfather, Tom, draws close to the grandson who was named after him when Tomie\\'s Uncle Charles (Tom\\'s son) goes off to fight in the war overseas. Young Tomie is also cast in the lead role of yet another of Miss Leah\\'s musical productions, and he brings down the house with his adroit and hilarious portrayal of King Neptune. The after-party is like a pleasant dream, as Tomie and the other dancers have a memorable night of celebration with their families in honor of a show well done. Young Tomie dances with Miss Leah and it all feels like a walk in the clouds, a night suspended from the dire realities of war, a night during which a boy can simply be happy in the company of friends. \\n The war continues, though, and Tomie can see that for however long it lasts, it is his responsibility, and the responsibility of every other patriotic American, to plug on ahead \"For the Duration\" and continue to support the soldiers risking life and limb overseas to defeat the Axis powers. It won\\'t be easy, Tomie knows, but he will do his part to render assistance as well as he can. \\n For the Duration is a good story, longer than any previous entry in the 26 Fairmount Avenue series. The continued theme is that of Tomie\\'s growing older, and as he grows, the charming antics that used to stand out about him so well have begun to fade just a bit. Perhaps it has more to do with the seriousness of the war that encompasses everything, but I can\\'t say for sure either way. \\n I enjoyed reading this book, and can hardly wait for the next installment of the series. Young Tomie is one of my favorite characters in literature, and it\\'s always fun to spend some time with him in these books. By this eighth addition to the 26 Fairmount Avenue mix, I feel as if I have known Tomie for my entire life! \\n I would give two and a half stars to this book.', 'Via Bo and Mama QRay \\n This is a must read/have for any book lover; and not just for your child\\'s bookshelf. If you find life in stories and through story tellers like we do; you really must get your hands on this one. \\n We have been big fans of Oliver Jeffers since the days of How to Catch a Star and can do nothing but love him even more for A Child of Books. Illustrated with lines from classic children\\'s tales alongside the whimsical Jeffers handwritten story lines; you will take a journey into transportive magic of books. \\n You know you have a real hit when the attention of a two year old is repeatedly drawn to the same story. \\n Bo says; \"READ!\"', 'This is a cute story about a small kitten who was born in a home that he didn\\'t choose to be in, to a lifestyle that he didn\\'t want and to an inheritance that he doesn\\'t want. While his sister chooses to continue with her inheritance and to become the best that she can be on that path Gobbolino chooses that he wants to live a more simple life that is contrary to the path that he normally would take. \\n The book takes you into the adventures of this special kitten from being abandoned by his mother and his mistress to finding so many good homes but being chased out from each due to the bias of what he was born as even when he shows to be anything but the \"normal\" witches\\' cat. And of course by the time Gobbolino comes full circle back to where he started he is also denied by the witches due to his gentle loving ways. \\n This story will definitely reach the heart of any child who has been seen different since of the background or life they didn\\'t choose since no matter the struggle they don\\'t fit in if they try to escape that first life. \\n The only thing that stopped this from being a 4-star book for me is the fact that even though I can related to Gobbolino the ending was a bit rushed while not having been the best ending that it could be. Still all in all it was a good general read for a younger audience.', \"Cried while reading this at storytime - so it was effective. Tried it out on younger readers and while we didn't have the discussion I would have with 1st and 2nd graders, they sat quietly and gravely. Clearly not a feel-good book but it already feels important.\", 'I\\'d love this book just for the hilarious pictures.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone...kid or adult. Very cute story.', 'Magical and captivating for young readers!!', \"Reincarnated as a cat living on the wall separating Jerusalem and Palestine, Clare spends her time remembering her old life as a regular girl while trying to stay alive in a war zone. Written in the spirit of a cautionary tale, Clare is the silent witness to two Israeli soldier's occupation of a Palestinian home. When a small child is discovered hiding and his teacher comes looking for him, tensions begins to rise very quickly. The danger is palpable, the realities of life in the Gaza strip vividly portrayed, giving middle grade readers a window into one of the world's trouble spots. Recommended as a study in comparative poverty and world issues.\", 'Once upon a time there was a girl that lived in a cold, cold city. It was so cold and snowy in this city that \"it didn\\'t seem to matter [to the girl] as she was mostly snow herself now. She breathed it, in and out. It collected in her gasping lungs. The snow was colonizing her, breath by breath.\" \\n The girl\\'s name is Hazel and the city is Minneapolis, Minnesota. Brrrrrrr...... \\n A fairy-tale twist on the Hans Christian Andersen\\'s, Snow Queen, Hazel is adjusting to a new school, one parent because her dad split from her mom, and a best friend who is a boy that doesn\\'t want to be her friend anymore because she\\'s a girl. Hazel struggles to fit in. She is creative and looks different from the other students as a result of being adopted from India. Her best friend Jack is the one person who makes her feel like she belongs. When he starts to show an interest in other boys his age and wants to be with them, Hazel is upset. Jack is going through his own family upheaval. His mom has depression and Jack and Hazel compare it to the Dementor\\'s in Harry Potter who steal peoples souls from them. Jack\\'s mom is described as having blank, soulless eyes. When a Snow Queen appears at the park where the kids sled Jack is lured away into an enchanted castle where only Hazel can rescue him. \\n What a wonderful book with fantastic character development and layered writing. Different phrases appear throughout the book that have to do with how the characters change such as Hazel describing herself and Jack as being \"scratchy and thick.\" Or how adults say one thing and mean another. Hazel realizes that it is supposed to make a person feel better but they are just \"plastic flowers of words.\" This is why at the end of the story she doesn\\'t try to make Jack feel better by saying \"everything will be alright.\" She knows their friendship is changing and that they might not be best friends forever. But she\\'s okay with that in the end because it was worth knowing Jack. I\\'m not sure if young readers will understand that or be confused by the ending. It might seem abrupt. I really liked it with the promise of the future and new things to come as symbolized by the ballet slippers. I also got a kick out of the signed Minnesota Twins Joe Mauer baseball which was the magical object that snapped Jack back to reality. I laughed thinking, \"Hazel\\'s magical wand is a baseball.\" I\\'m a Twins fan so I loved the unique choice. \\n Hazel and Jack use their imaginations to play, oftentimes acting out stories. The novel is inundated with references to books and movies such as Narnia, When You Reach Me, Peter Pan, The Golden Compass, Harry Potter, The Little Match Girl, The 12 Dancing Princesses, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and more. The author weaves them in the story line and they are, oftentimes, quite funny. For instance, when Jack gets into the sleigh the witch says, \"Would you like some Turkish Delight?\" Edmund was lured by the White Witch in the Chronicles of Narnia from being fed Turkish Delight. Or the part where Hazel asks a woman if she\\'s seen Jack. The woman reponds, \"The princess saving a knight, eh?\" \"...I hope the knight doesn\\'t mind.\" \\n The beginning of the story is realistic and the second half is fantasy. When I was Hazel\\'s age I would act out books with my best friend. We sat smothered in a hot closet of winter coats wishing with all our hearts for the back to open into the world of Narnia. That\\'s why I loved the twist in this book where it actually happens to Hazel. All that pretending and she and Jack get to enter their make-believe magical fairy tale world. But to Hazel\\'s surprise the world of imagination is more dangerous than reality. The author\\'s description of cold weather will make you feel like an icicle and I recognized some of the places she describes in the book. Minnesota is my home town so this added another layer of fun for me when reading the story.', 'just bought on fishpondworld.com \\n A darling story of fear and overcoming fear of the unknown. \\n We all struggle with it, I think, in one way or another. \\n Loved it so much!', 'A Level 1 Reader all about your favorite ponies! \\n Features Read-Aloud/Read to Me functionality where available.

This is the second story in the AN AWFULLY BEASTLY BUSINESS series. \\n The story starts out with Baron Marackai and his minions dropping grenades over the side of their boat. They are attempting to rouse sea monsters from the deep. Baron Marackai has evil plans to get as many sea monsters as he can and then eat them: for they are delicious. His minions fear that the RSPCB (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Beasts) will seek retaliation against them. \\n Later, the bizarre Captain Crab brings his fishing boat to Farraway Hall, the headquarters for the RSPCB. He is hauling an injured sea monster. And it's not just any sea monster; it's a Redback, the most deadly sea monster! But Dr. Fielding at the RSPCB can't figure out how it sustained a skull injury. It normally dwells on the bottom of the sea, far from people. \\n Dr. Fielding is aided by Ulf, a werewolf, and together, they figure out a way to save the Redback. But their good deeds quickly get overshadowed by the return of the long-lost son of the founder of Farraway Hall.

It is a very imaginative and a fun way to show a child that they can be a superhero also. The young boy starts his bedtime routine by getting a signal that it's time for bed from his father (his father points to the clock) just like Batman gets the Bat signal in the sky. The boy begins by walking up the stairs where he gets his bat cape. When Batman gets his signal, he must prepare by changing his clothes, donning his bat cape and preparing his Batmobile. The boy knows that his goldfish depend on him just like Batman knows that other people depend on him, the boy and Batman have many similarities. As the book continues, we read about many other connections that the two superheroes have. Situated on opposing pages, I liked that I was able to see how these connections were made and how they matched up. This was a cartoon book with bright colored pages with sharp edges in color.

As usual, Markle has gathered a great deal of information and stunning pictures and told readers of all ages a very important story. I like the wording and combination of images, facts, and antidotes to bring the Amur Leopards to life. I will admit, I knew little to nothing about this particular species, and found myself fascinated with these beautiful creatures. My daughter is obsessed with animals, and I think this series of books about saving endangered is so well organized and worded that I will have a hard time convincing her to put the book down, and to save running off into the wild to save these leopards until she is a little older (she just turned 8). \\n The Great Leopard Rescue is another comprehensive and well written non fiction book for children from Markle.

On one hand, it is an impressive tying together of the series, a wonderful penultimate journey through the previous eleven books. On the other, it is unsettling, a fatalistic blow that buries the most redeeming aspects of the series beneath a darkness with implications I shudder to think about. \\n First, the good. The Penultimate Peril brings together many familiar characters and places them in a situation that is entertaining and appropriate. Those reading the story aloud will have to strain to remember the voices of so many characters throughout the series and keep them straight (not an easy task, but I was up for the challenge). The drama, action, and humor are all turned to full for this chapter in the Baudelaire story. It\\'s a good mix, and certainly a wonderful addition. \\n But the decisions made by our \"heroes,\" well, they seem out of character, though there was some indication of it in the previous volume. This sudden change in approach, this resignation to despair and acceptance of fate is very fatalistic. I understand--and have liked--Snicket\\'s growing maturity throughout the series, forcing bigger words and larger questions as the book number increased, but this may be going to far. Not only does it all seem forced, but the reactions themselves are rather insipid. Perhaps this is merely an indication of what is to come in the final book--maybe this change is purely a plot device for the final chapter--but in the meantime, the only heroes a child can have in this series have been dashed against the cliffs of a pessimistic philosophy. As the Baudelaires would say in this chapter of their lives, eventually they\\'d only have failed you anyway. \\n Though a series of unfortunate events, A Series of Unfortunate Events has always shown some glimmer of hope, if in no other way than in the hearts of the Baudelaires. Now, looking out at the coming horizon, it looks quite bleak. I guess Snicket said all along it wouldn\\'t be a happy ending, but I didn\\'t expect the darkness to infect everything.

How about the women?\"(p.6). \\n This young reader book is profound in its message toward youth as well as adults. From the outset, the book drives the point that women are not mentioned in the history of the making of the United States, not because they did not act, but because they simply were not written about. Black, Native American, and White, women rode farther than Paul Revere; were the impetus for the strength of the boycott against English tea and merchandise (not afraid to tar and feather traitors to the cause); wrote pamphlets, newspapers, and inspirational lyrics; and followed men to the front lines and dressed in men\\'s clothing to take up arms fighting bravely, suffering injury, freeing prisoners of war, nursing the wounded, burying the dead, and carrying secrets. And, their service was once acknowledged! George Washington recognized African slave Phillis Wheatley for her famous poems of the Revolution, and called the women who cooked and cleaned for soldiers \"Women of the Army.\" Women earned military pay and military pensions, and were renowned for fighting off enemy troops. Yet, only the great men of the Revolution earned their names in print. Anderson knows the way to rectify this is to start digging through our own family histories for the truth. The dedication of the book leads the charge. It reads, \"Dedicated to my Revolutionary grandmothers,\" listing the author\\'s own 22 mothers of the Revolution.', 'TBR: from the GayStarNews: A fairy tale with a difference is set to transform how young transgender children view themselves. \\n \\'A Royal Heart\\' explores the messages of love, family and acceptance through the eyes of a young prince, Lyric, who feels like a princess on the inside. \\n After realising she doesn\\'t feel able to be a King, the teenage prince transforms into a princess on her 16th birthday, with the help of her loving grandmother. \\n \\'Now Lyric stood as a beautiful girl dressed in a royal gown,\\' the story explains. \\n \\'Lyric finally felt free.

In 'Love Lessons' she approaches perhaps the most controversial of topics, that of a forbidden student-teacher relationship. Prue is just fourteen, but is drawn dangerously close to her handsome, outgoing art teacher, Rax. \\n Prue's home life is challenging, to say the least, although I found parts of it to be overly exaggerated which took away from the overall believablilty of the book. Her father is controlling, domineering and quite the bully. Conversely, her mum is passive and afraid to stand up to her husband. She is not allowed control of money, and makes her own clothes and that of her two daughters. \\n When Prue's dad suffers a stroke and is rendered helpless in hospital, Prue is suddenly allowed a little freedom. She can socialise, she can buy what she wants. She doesn't need to tip toe around the house anymore. \\n Although I applaud Wilson for choosing to write about this controversial topic, I worried about the message it sends out to impressionable readers. When Rax implies he loves Prue, this suggests that when an adult tells a child this, it makes whatever might be morally wrong (or in this case, illegal) okay. It doesn't matter if the child is not afraid or feels she is being exploited, but that the adult is taking advantage. \\n I would suggest that this book is best saved for more mature young readers.\", 'This is a fun way to introduce counting and multiplication.

When she spied a wild-looking one eyed cat which appeared to be peering directly at her, she followed it, stumbling into a room full of partying people all in fancy dress - but what was happening? Who were these people and why was their speech and manner so different? \\n It took her awhile but she finally realized she was no longer in New York, in fact she was no longer in her own time - ancient Egypt was where she had ended up.

The story itself is twenty-five pages long and is geared toward children ages 4 to 8. The time it takes to read aloud is about three minutes - though it may be longer depending on your reading style and how dramatic you make your performance. For example, when Joseph \"knock, knock, knocks on every door,\" you may stop and pretend to knock or tap on something.

One page of text says, \"One small donkey with a hee-hee-haw! / Cheering at the Savior\\'s birth / One small donkey with a giant heart / Welcomes Christ, our peace on earth.\" Each of the quatrains starts with the words \"One small donkey.\" The illustrations are slightly reminiscent of old claymation Christmas specials, and many of Miguens\\' drawings feature serene blue tones. \\n *I received this book for review*', 'I love this book do much I want to marry it.

The book is set up as a conversation between mother and child, where the child asks questions about his new brother or sister. The mother's text is in light blue and the child's is in black so readers can differentiate who is speaking. After the introduction, the book flips between the conversation between mother and child and a wordless future sequence (e.g. 'Maybe when the baby grows up, it will be a chef and work in a restaurant.' 'I don't think I'd eat anything that was made by the baby.' Then there is a six panel page spread of the future baby trying to make pancakes.). \\n The illustrations go back and forth between being very detailed (like the illustration of mother and child going through the snow) to very simple (like some of the wordless page sequences). Familiar objects are used throughout the book, the human features are very simple, but the coloring is very realistic and neat, not as explosive as some of the books for younger children. \\n The sentences run anywhere from 2-6 per page, so overall that would make it inappropriate for a younger child. The dialogue is overall very simple, so a younger child could understand it, but they might not get some of the references (such as Peter Parker). There is little rhyming or repetition other than with the word 'baby,' but the format of the book itself is very repetitious (e.g. mother and child talking, then wordless sequences). \\n Because of these factors, the book isn't entirely appropriate for those under the age of 4.

I don\\'t know about you, but I\\'d probably make some really weird choices, too, if I was trying to keep from being mauled by the undead. \\n And the structure of this story? \\n Definitely not the norm.

The first chapter, for example, is: \\n Step 1 \\n Find Zombie Cave \\n If you ever need to survive a zombie infested treasure hunt, this would be a good ebook to have with you. And bonus! As an ebook, it has a backlight. Very useful in dark terrain. \\n What?! I\\'m just saying... it may be a good supply to have with you. \\n This book feels like it would be a spectacular read for 4-6th grade readers. It\\'s not long, having a page length roughly equivalent to a Goosebumps story. \\n Don\\'t worry - I\\'m not comparing it to Goosebumps. \\n Mick Bogerman\\'s work is a unique entity that doesn\\'t need to be compared to anything to stand out as something a young reader would enjoy... and ask for more of.

Mau pindah, repot banget), saya tengah membaca juga Pangeran Yang Selalu Bahagia (The Happy Prince) karya Oscar Wilde. Keduanya sama-sama dongeng kanak-kanak. Bedanya, yang pertama adalah novel sedangkan yang kedua kumpulan cerita. Seperti lazimnya dongeng, kita akan selalu mendapatkan petuah mengenai kebajikan di samping fantasi-fantasi menakjubkan tentang tumbuhan dan hewan yang dapat berbicara, misalnya. \\n Pangeran Kecil terbit pertama kali dalam bahasa Prancis - Le Petit Prince - pada tahun 1943. Penulisnya, Antoine de Saint-Exupery adalah seorang pilot selama menjalani wajib militer (1923). Selain terbang, ia pun suka menulis.

Termasuk Pangeran Kecil ini. \\n Kisah ini dimulai saat pesawat yang dikemudikan oleh \"aku\", jatuh di Gurun Sahara. Sendirian di tengah padang pasir yang gersang dan sunyi, bermil-mil jauhnya dari \"peradaban\", berbekal sedikit air minum, membuat tokoh aku berpikir sebentar lagi ia pasti mati.

Dalam pengembaraannya, Pangeran Kecil ini tiba di Bumi. \\n Sebelum sampai di Bumi, ia terlebih dahulu menyinggahi enam buah planet lain dengan kisahnya masing-masing. Dari perjalanan dan perjumpaannya dengan para penghuni planet-planet itu, kita mendapatkan pelajaran berharga tentang watak manusia dan kehidupan. \\n Dengan keluguan seorang bocah yang tak henti bertanya, dongeng ini menyuguhkan nasihat-nasihat arif kepada pembacanya. Bukan saja anak-anak tetapi pembaca dewasa pun dapat memetik hikmah dari novel ini : kasih sayang, persahabatan, kesetiaan. Tak perlu merasa malu belajar dan berguru kepada anak-anak. \\n Buku tipis ini dilengkapi pula dengan ilustrasi menarik yang dibuat sendiri oleh penulisnya.

The Prologue was especially thought-provoking. \\n It was a bit slow in the beginning, but once I pushed through those first 30 or so pages, there was a nice flow going that carried me to the end of the book. Speaking of the ending, I feel like it was a little glossed over. I think the author either should have saved that part for the next book or simply expanded the ending. \\n Overall, I really liked the idea behind this book. It tied in demons and parallel universes and all that stuff. I've read so many demons and angels book but I've never read one that focused on the things that haunt us in our sleep. Because, admit it, even adults have nightmares. \\n As for the characters, I did get a little annoyed with Stetson at times but he just acted the way a kid his age would. His thought process did mature a lot throughout the book as expected (he IS involved in some important stuff). I think Paris is my favorite character. She kind of reminds me of myself actually. I would like a lot more explanation about the whole powers thing. That seemed to come out of nowhere and then all of a sudden they just dropped it. In the next book perhaps? \\n The plot was very good. It wasn't constant action but it wasn't constant speculation and talking either. It did waver a bit between the Boogerman's reputation and the whole apocalypse thing but overall it was quite enjoyable. \\n The Final Verdict: \\n A pretty compelling read with a nice flow. A variety of ages would enjoy it - go onion books!! The characters were consistent with their ages and the plot was good. I do wish the ending would have been expanded a bit more and have more explanation about the powers. \\n 3.5 stars\", \"I read this so long ago I couldn't even give you a rating on it.

I love the way Martin used such simple elements + details, and still managed to write a compelling, moving tale. I'm quite fond of this book (it reminded me of how I felt about Counting by 7s)! \\n REVIEW: \\n (Originally posted on Alexa Loves Books) \\n As someone who was obsessed with The Baby-Sitters Club novels in my younger years*, it was a no-brainer to say yes when I was offered the chance to read Rain Reign. Immersing myself in Martin's writing felt like slipping on an old, fuzzy sweater - cozy, comfortable and perfectly worn in. I fell hard for Rose Howard, and this compelling snapshot of a pivotal moment in her life. \\n Rose Howard is the reason I enjoyed Rain Reign tremendously. It does take some time to get used to the way she thinks, and her obsession with homonyms, prime numbers and following the rules. But underneath all of that is a young girl with a lot of heart, curiosity and intelligence. She offers a unique perspective on everything, even though there are things (like her emotions + day to day life) that most of us can identify with. \\n Rose's relationships - with her dog Rain, her uncle Weldon, her father Wesley, with her teachers and classmates - are all big parts of what make her story come alive. She, as an individual, is already interesting, but putting her in situations with others amps that up. The fascination, for me, comes in both her observations of others and the way other people react to her. It adds extra character and heart to Rain Reign, and I'm convinced Rose's story would have turned out differently without these people. \\n Rain Reign maintains the perfect balance between heartwarming and heartbreaking, mixing the two extremes in a way that mirrors reality well. Being privy to Rose's thoughts and narration make it easy to understand (and like) her. You'll be rooting for her before you know it! I really enjoyed Martin's newest offering, and am confident many others are going to feel the same.\", \"Or maybe 3.5 stars. I did like it - Stead has a readable, funny style that's appealing, and her characters are quirky and real. I liked how she addressed bullying, and the loneliness that comes from feeling different and having parents who are often absent. \\n But it sometimes felt slow to me. While there is the plot of the kids spying in their apartment building, it didn't always feel like the story was moving forward.\", 'Sweet story with real and imaginary characters - heartwarming and sad', 'Read this book many years ago. I always liked it for some reason. I guess it was the empowerment of children that inspired me. Every child wants to feel important and take charge.

Good read!', \"Would be a funny readaloud for maybe 2nd-5th grade if you're in the mood to do some character voices, and if you don't mind a little PG violence.\", 'One of my kids favorite books.', 'Fun and easy to read.', 'Have your kids ever wondered if their toys could talk or if they could possibly be real? If they have, then they\\'re not alone. The Toy Story movies, based on just that concept, are popular for a reason! It\\'s hard to believe that it was 1922 when Margery Williams first addressed that same subject, in The Velveteen Rabbit. Although it was written over 80 years ago, most kids will still relate to this story about a stuffed rabbit that wishes desperately to be real. Told from the point of view of the rabbit, readers get a glimpse into a toy\\'s life; they discover how the toys treat each other, and that some, like the Velveteen Rabbit, are self-conscious while others are arrogant. \\n One toy, a kind horse, has been around for many years, and shares his knowledge with the rabbit. He explains that it is possible to become \"real\" if a toy is loved enough. It happens over a long period of time, and only to a special few. When truly loved, the toy may be worn and tattered, but appearances won\\'t matter. The rabbit would give anything to be \"real\" but he must be patient. For a while, he is forgotten on a shelf, but one day, he gets lucky and is given the chance to comfort the boy. He becomes his constant companion and his cherished friend, and eventually sees for himself what it feels like to be \"real.\" Later, when the boy becomes sick and the doctor says that the rabbit must be cast aside, the rabbit is so sad that he cries a real tear. At that moment, he experiences the magic that leads him to know what \"real\" truly means. As in The Miraculous Journey of Edward Toulane, the rabbit must know sadness before he can become real. \\n When you first read this book, it might seem surprising that this short and simple tale has endured for so long, but there are subtle messages that make it special. The magical relationships and the extraordinary power of love will stay with readers long after they put the book down. Although it is Reader Junior, the vocabulary and sentence structure may be challenging for newly independent readers.

It begins with the building of the railroad, coming from east and west and meeting in the middle. Filled with the sounds of building and the sounds of trains, this book fairly sings with the noises of the railroad. Your trip starts on a quiet platform waiting for a train. Once aboard, readers learn about the way steam powers the engine and the jobs of different people aboard. Readers ride aboard the train, visit the bathroom which is basically a hole in the floor, and sleep along the way. On the way west, you can see the landscape change, cross fragile bridges and enter black tunnels. This entire book is a stirring testament to steam engines and the people who worked them. \\n Floca offers so many details here. One might think that would slow the book down, but it is really all about those details and the entire experience of travel by steam train. He keeps the interest level high by being very selective of the facts he shares. It makes the reading fascinating and even young train buffs should learn a thing or two. \\n Floca's illustrations are beautiful. He lingers over details in his images as well as in the text. Readers get to see mechanisms close up, feel the speed of the train as it moves forward, and see the light reflecting off of the tight tunnel walls. He creates an experience here that speaks to the time period clearly with his choice of fonts and the design of the entire book. His illustrations are sometimes front and center, other times serving more as diagrams of interesting facts. \\n Gorgeous illustrations, fascinating facts and a clear love of the subject make this a riveting read whether you are a train buff or not. Appropriate for ages 7-10.\", 'A good read for the early chapter readers. My son is really into it.

The rhyming text is perfect and the illustrations expand on it with gentle humour, so there's plenty to talk about on every page. I particularly loved the double spread showing Mum as a donkey: it brought back so many memories! But all of the illustrations deserve close attention. Parents are sure to recognize themselves here, whether they're the dad trying to read while holding up the children's tent, or the mum napping on the sofa. \\n This is definitely a book to be treasured. I loved it!\", \"Princess Bella is the most beautiful princess in the land, yet she always looks unhappy and sad, even-though she is not. This was because no-one had ever seen or heard her laugh. The King and Queen had tried numerous times to find out why, but with nothing ever being found wrong with the Princess, they were left baffled. The country's people deemed her to be cold like ice, and gave her the title 'The Ice Princess'. \\n Whilst up in the tower one day, Bella finds herself dragon-napped by a friendly dragon named Spurlock. Spurlock has taken the Princess as he needs her help with a problem of his, and being 'The Ice Princess', she was perfect for the job. Bella thought that what Spurlock wanted to do was hilarious, and so she laughed and laughed, but her laugh made a horrible ear-splitting noise. \\n Bella asked Spurlock to take her back to the castle and invited him to live with her family, as he was such a friendly dragon, but was Spurlock really a dragon, and why did Bella have such an awful laugh? \\n Princess Bella and the Dragon's Curse is a fun, young children's fairy-tale, containing magic, knights, royalty, a dragon and an evil witch, all good things a fairy-tale should have! \\n I loved the plot, and Bella certainly is the most beautiful princess that has ever lived, and Spurlock is such a cute dragon. \\n I would have liked to have seen more illustrations throughout, as these tend to be what holds children to the pages and keeps them interested. That said, the pictures that are in the book are bright, colourful and eye-catching. \\n If your children love fairy-tales, adventure and Princesses, then this book will capture their imagination and have them realising that love comes in all shapes and sizes. \\n Reviewed by Stacey at www.whisperingstories.com\", 'My 9yo says, \"Heart touching.\"', 'Very interesting story about a New England boy\\'s dream to be outside and how it led to his work on New York City\\'s Central Park.

Odd reads more like an outline of itself than the full story. I think that the entire story could have been fleshed out more. The village that Odd lives in has no character or history, when a more thorough description of his peoples\\' way of life would have enhanced the story a lot. Similarly, Odd\\'s final \"battle\" with the Frost Giant seems too easy. There was room for more description, more dialogue, and more suspense. \\n The three characters of the bear, fox, and eagle could also have been explored a lot more.

Well, I got that feeling with this book. I started reading it at 8:00 am this morning, finished it at 8:00 pm tonight, and worked for eight hours in between, as well as having a beer with a friend. Okay, you might say that I am a fast reader, but I am not. Seriously, I literally felt like I blinked and missed this book. \\n It is not that I couldn't follow it or simply skipped over it, and to prove it to you (without reading any commentary from Goodreads or the synopsis from Wikipedia) I will tell you what happened. The Secret Seven have a meeting and decide to play Indians (because they have no adventure to go on). While playing Indians they encounter a rather suspicious looking individual. Later they discover that a pearl necklace has been stolen from a house where they were playing Indians so decide to investigate. Their investigations lead them to a circus where they discover a couple of acrobats were involved, and then inform the police: mystery solved. \\n Mind you, their methods are completely different to those of the Famous Five. The Famous Five go on adventures however the Secret Seven solve mysteries. There is a difference, and in fact there is a big difference. With the adventures the characters are simply carried along by the events, and while they do act to influence them, and do a bit of snooping, basically the plot is dictated by the events. With a mystery there is a lot more investigating and puzzle solving involved. Okay, once again I had pretty much worked out what had been going on as soon as the second clue was uncovered (though I suspected that the crooks pole volted over the fence as opposed to using stilts, but I was still pretty close), but this story involved gathering clues and then piecing the puzzle together. \\n Once again this differs from other mysteries that I have read (Sherlock Holmes and Biggles) where the information is fed to you as they protagonists work it out. Here the clues are provided to you to try to get you to work it out before the protagonists. I discovered that in the first book and found that this was the case in the second. This style probably makes the story more enjoyable as it is engaging your brain a lot more than simply revealing things as the protagonists work it out. In the end I must say that I enjoyed this book more than the first, though I am a little disappointed that Scamps is not an official member of the club.\", \"Why did I buy this? \\n It shows a kid young enough to be put in time out be left ALONE in the children's room. \\n It shows the child going amok--partly in her imagination, but partly I think for real--in that children's room. \\n In other words, this is a book that encourages the sort of behavior parents and nannies allow in the library already. \\n Feh..........\", 'I thought this was a great way to end the trilogy.

Although I haven't read War Horse, I was in the minority that didn't like the movie. I actually bought this book months ago, so I took my time to read it! \\n Basically this is the story of Aman, a refugee from Afghanistan.

His best mate Matt tells the sad story to his Grandfather, a journalist, who visits Aman in the detention centre and gets his story to the world. \\n I enjoyed the personal effect of the story being told to another, and the breakdown of chapters.

I liked the dog too, Shadow is a great little character. \\n Definitely five stars, parents read along with your children so you can explain some of the darkness to them.\", \"I love the prose and the pictures. A good model for writer's workshop\", 'Minerva is spoiled. A \"queen\" among queens. Her parents are too busy to pay attention or discipline her, and her servants have no choice but to serve her every whim. Her nannies, well they run from this troublesome terror. That is until the 53rd nanny arrives to crown her the queen of a kingdom of monsters. Some clever reverse psychology on her part does wonders. What little girl wants to live among a bunch of nasty, messy monsters afterall. Hearing how these creatures act like a certain misbehaving child, Minerva learns to not take her fortunate lifestyle for granted. As she gets ready for bed, the beasts in the background continue to cause trouble, looking more and more dejected as she behaves. \\n For this story of a child spoiled rotten, the artist created spindly, elongated, and deformed characters to match this horrific nature. Additionally, it works well within the context of a monster infested world, a kingdom which Minerva nearly claims. Desaturated colours maintain this expressionistic style, however it refrains from being truly frightening because of the prominent pinks and purples. \\n Poetic and eloquent, even with the choice of subject matter, this is one of the few authors who goes beyond the use of mere rhyme. Devices include: alliteration, imagery, onomatopoeia, and the author often gives multiple examples or descriptions for emphasis. Older children will appreciate the writing\\'s quality, use of uncommon words, and clever lesson.', \"World's worst book about the world's worst fairy godmother? Maybe.

My mom, awesome lady that she is, fueled my passion for books at a young age and this was one of the many books she purchased for me. Out of all of the books I owned as a kid, this is the one that I remember the best and read the most. It\\'s been YEARS, maybe over 15, since I\\'ve read it and I still have vivid memories of reading this and crying. \\n In fact, I think this was the first book EVER that gave me all the feels. I still remember the signature line from the book: \\n \"Love you forever. Like you for always. As long as I\\'m living, my baby, you\\'ll be.\"', 'You can also read this review on my blog. \\n In short: The Giver by Lois Lowry is clearly a very special book with a profound thoughtfulness to it that I don\\'t usually see in the dystopians of today. \\n I have certainly read my fair share of dystopians and at this point they have all started to blend together as I inevitably end up seeing the same trends and tropes over and over again. So to read The Giver, a classic in the dystopian genre, after all this time and after reading tons of newer dystopians that follow the same basic outline, is a strange experience. Here, in The Giver is the origination of many of the themes and motifs that populate the dystopians of today and yet I didn\\'t first come by these common dystopian trends with the originator, but with the followers. \\n But thankfully, The Giver didn\\'t read to me as \"been there, done that\" as many dystopians do these days. Even with the same basic format that I\\'ve seen again and again in this genre, The Giver brought to the table a profound thoughtfulness that I don\\'t usually see in the dystopians of today. The Giver keeps things simple when it comes to world building, which would normally be a problem for me in any other book in the same genre, but here it works because it puts the focus on the important messages of the novel, rather than in the details of the world. \\n I am SO late to this party, but I\\'m glad I have finally read this classic novel! The Giver is clearly a special book and it doesn\\'t surprise me that it is often a staple in classrooms for study. I do regret that I never read it in school growing up because it would have been a great and powerful introduction not only to the dystopian genre, but to many profound life lessons. I am pretty doubtful that the movie adaptation will do this book justice. Thoughts? \\n Question to those who have read the entire series: is it a must for me to read the final three books? I am a bit conflicted about the end of The Giver because part of me feels it is incomplete, but another part of me thought the book on the whole to be a solid read and I don\\'t want my experience of it to be ruined.', 'I wouldn\\'t have normally picked this book up; it looks a little too hippy for my taste, something more designed for the moms who say things like \"let\\'s welcome that little boy to use the slide\" instead of my more retro bellow of \"son, it\\'s HIS turn now!\" However, Linda Ashman\\'s book Rain! is one of my son\\'s Top Ten books so I wanted to try more by the author. \\n This is a title designed to teach conflict management. Kids face various frustrating situations and instead of reacting by crying or pushing, they\\'re encouraged to try \"peace, baby.\" I like the idea of showing the kinds of situations that kids might face and modeling a better way to handle it. I have a few problems with this book though that I will share here as a warning. If you read this review before you read the book to your kid, you can make some of your own adaptations before it\\'s too late! \\n First, \"peace, baby\" is still something I never want to be caught saying to my kid in public. I\\'m sorry, but no. Second, I have a three-year-old and he objected to the \"baby\" designation, so something like \"kiddo\" might have gone over better. If I were writing this book, I would try to think of a word or phrase that could be a sort of secret passcode between parent and child to be used to remind them to stop and regroup. Something that wouldn\\'t be an obvious reprimand, and that could be a fun secret between the two of them. Finally, for me the biggest takeaway I wanted my son to have is to stop and breathe when frustrated, so I added that to each recitation of \"peace, baby.\" He must have thought the peace thing a little much too, because in a giggly mood one evening he renamed it \"car, baby\" and has never allowed us to go back. \\n So, not my favorite book, but with some modifications it\\'s better for me. My son loves it and that\\'s always the true test of a picture book, so I\\'ll still give it 4 stars.', 'The naptastrophe was not as napastrophic as I was expecting/hoping.', 'We loved this story.

Syukurlah, ada sebuah lapak buku online yang menjual satu judul dimana sewaktu kecil aku pernah menonton filmnya (sayangnya aku tidak begitu ingat). \\n Gaya Bahasa dan Kosa Kata \\n Tidak perlu dipertanyakan lagi bagaimana Road Dahl bisa membawa pembacanya ke tingkatan imaji yang menyenangkan, tidak peduli mereka muda ataupun tua.

Tokoh-tokohnya dibuat sederhana namun masing-masing memiliki karakter yang khas. Seperti misalnya tokoh Lipan yang gemar bernyanyi atau Ulat Sutra yang kerjanya hanya tidur. Serunya lagi, tokoh-tokoh serangga tersebut tidak digambarkan sebagai sosok yang menjijikkan. \\n Yang Aku Suka \\n Siapa sih yang tidak suka dengan daya imajinasi yang tidak terbatas? Ketika apa yang dalam dunia kita (apalagi jika kita sudah bukan lagi anak-anak) tidak akan pernah terjadi, dalam buku-buku Road Dahl semua ketidakmungkinan tersebut menjadi suatu yang menakjubkan. Sama halnya seperti akhir kisah James dan buah persik raksasa berisi serangga-serangga menarik.

Major people in Lincoln's life receive no name at all, such as his stepmother and three of his four boys. \\n The book also dodges any mention of death other than the death of his mother. That's a tricky feat given Lincoln. There's nothing in this book about his sister's death or the two of his own sons that died during Lincoln's life.

He made a deal with the devil, which while it will likely save Earth, it will doom many other planets to be taken over by a parasitic insectoid race of aliens. This fits in perfectly with the exploration of the morality and ethics of a superpowered human who could very well decide that he doesn't want to help people but do whatever he wants.

For the movie, his story was changed drastically (and in m opinion bears almost no resemblance to the version that hit the screen), but he's still credited on IMDB as a screenwriter along with Walon Green. I'm no expert in movie hierarchy, though, so look that bit up on your own. \\n I enjoyed this graphic novel. It read very much like a screenplay written by Frank Miller. If you're into him, you will probably like this. At times it was cliche and predictable, but every time I saw this I reminded myself it was a movie screenplay first -- that has to fit a certain format, and usually everything you see you see for a reason because it's coming back later. \\n The character of Dr. Love stole the show. She's a classic corporate sleaze, work with, full of double-speak and self-justifying every possible wrong and evil she did. \\n I would have given this four stars, but the art dropped it down some. While the art was beautiful, in many places the action was impossible to follow. I kept flipping back pages to see what I was missing. I did this in enough places that it became really bothersome. So, lovely to look at, but laid out in an order that didn't connote a logical flow of action. Maybe if you like shaky-cam movies, that won't bother you a bit.\", \"Wednesday Comics was a 12-week experiment DC Comics ran last summer. Every week a new newspaper-sized comic was released with each page continuing a character's story from the week before. \\n Of course major characters like Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern were featured, but some of the more compelling stories featured Kamandi, the last human on a future world inhabited by sentient animals; and Metamorpho, whose ability to transform into any element is lampooned by writer Neil Gaiman. \\n Since it was experimental, results vary. Deadman, a character I'm not typically interested in, has a great story and the team of Dave Bullock and Vinton Heuck make excellent use of the oversize page. On the other hand, the Wonder Woman story by Ben Caldwell reads like a layout nightmare. \\n My favorite stories were the Metamorpho one mentioned above and Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner's Supergirl. Those two are easily the most fun in the collection. \\n Final word: this is an extremely oversized hardcover so expect it to be huge.\", \"Thanks Jenna for recommending me this series! \\n I learned about the Meiji period in my Asian Studies class back in the day, but it's books like Rurouni Kenshin that really gauge my interest in history. Though Rurouni Kenshin employs a lot of the common tropes we typically see in manga/anime - characters with a Dark and Troubled Past, Badass Adorable, the list goes on - but since Rurouni Kenshin is the first manga I've read in a lonnnnngggg time, it was fun and nostalgic. \\n If this one had a wish, it would only be that her lie would become a truth of this world. \\n Gosh, I don't know. There's something so sweet about this. But since it's the first volume of many, I'll withhold from writing a full review; I'll probably write a review for 4 - 6 volumes at a time! But, here's a quick summary of thought: \\n - Compelling historical context. Set in the Meiji period, the country is rife with changes in social and political structures entailing discord and instability, internal politics, and people who have been displaced after the Tokugawa period. \\n - Adorable but badass character. Usually the tropes that make up his character bug me, but Kenshin is so endearing. Following his involvement as a revolutionary warrior, Kenshin remains an engima in this book but I think he is trying to seek a peace that is, at this point, he feels he does not deserve. I have a feeling Kenshin is one of those 'onion-layered' characters who will probably remain enigma until we learn more about him. \\n - Antagonists are less characters and are more than a representation of the different perspectives, political/military ideologies, and/or war-mongering ideals that existed within the period. This was okay by me - it allowed for dialectic on the meanings of justice, peace, and war. \\n - Interesting dynamic between the main characters; I can't wait to see how each will develop and realise their potential. \\n Can't wait to read more! :D \\n (Ignore the rating; it is more of a 'base' rating for the series so I can measure future books relative to this rating.)\", 'Captain Marvel saved Christmas with SANTA. !!!

Not to mention the pain of being the \"different\" one at school!', \"starling didn't get into this series because it's confusing. and it is. there is time traveling, clones, battling factions from the future. I am sticking with it, though, because vaughan is such a damn smart writer. even the little aphorisms about time between sections are brilliant. and despite men working on it, girls are the protagonists, which is refreshing. it's been compared to stranger things because the kids are from the 80s.\", \"This was one of my favorites. I can't help but reread it again. I want to read more.\", '\"Maybe it\\'s because I\\'ve been doing horror manga for so long,\" writes manga-ka Senno Knife, \"but I end up envisioning horror in ordinary day-to-day life such as walking down the street.\" \\n For many writers of modern-day horror, this penchant for seeing the bizarre and terrifying in seemingly innocuous daily detail has proven to be successful. Practically everything, from cymbal-clanging mechanical monkeys to fancy Cadillacs, has been featured in a horror story in some capacity. For Senno Knife, the ordinary comes in such forms as a stuffed koala bear, a high school swimming pool, and even a gumball machine (each story told in the form of a Japanese urban legend played out from start to finish). \\n The trouble with the formula in this volume (Ordinary + Supernatural = Terror) is tough to pinpoint exactly. The biggest issue is that the book is simply more groan-inducing than spine-tingling. One possibility is that the book, written for a younger audience, contains dull and uninspired dialogue, often reciting obvious factual information previously stated by the narrator or even the comic\\'s images. Another could be the mandated brevity of each short story, disallowing proper time to create and establish a scene of extended normality prior to firing the entire works into a spiral of horror. \\n And of course, there\\'s always the possibility of something being lost in translation. In Japan, the \"horror season\" comes in the dead of summer, when kids tell scary stories around the campfire in an attempt to \"chill\" the summer\\'s heat away. The tales told to, and often by, children are often more vivid and terrifying than ones shared by the likes of Christopher Pike and R. L. Stine (for instance, the child-oriented Yu-Gi-Oh! manga contains details of death and mutilation not seen in the American TV version). While these stories can frighten children, they are usually not of the caliber expected by a more mature reading audience, thereby causing the stories to fall flat by comparison. \\n This book, however, still has much merit regardless of such weaknesses. If read immediately before falling asleep, many of the frightening images can be inflected into one\\'s subconscious, due to reappear during the sleeping hours as nightmares: innocent victims falling to their deaths, seemingly suspended in mid-air on the black-and-white page; bulge-eyed demons bent on exacting torturous revenge on children and adults alike for minor transgressions; human mouths filled with dagger-sharp reptilian teeth, jaws contorted and expelling harsh, abrasive laughter. \\n Given enough time and space, and adequately \"adapted\" for North American audiences, Senno Knife shows the potential to weave a truly terrifying story indeed. A span of a mere thirty-something pages, though, does not grant enough time to establish very much.', '** spoiler alert ** \\n I am resolved to read this book twice. If you are reading for the enjoyment of \"Fun Home\" forget it. Read this book for understanding Ms. Bechdel, but moreover, to understand yourself. This book is overwrought, tedious, precise, drags at times. Thus, it is probably the perfect description of the author herself in person. \\n Alison\\'s mother described this book as a \\'metabook\\' and that it is exactly. Expect to feeling the urge to read your college-level psychology texts again. The narrative is fluid, bumpy, elastic. Unlike \"Fun Home,\" it will be difficult to insert oneself as Alison, or be able to become her character. She is weird, quirky, and self-absorbed to the point of nauseating me as I read. That said, the book, whether unconsciously or subconsciously, does unveil themes related to her preoccupation of Winnicot. \\n Por ejemplo, the discussion of the \"spontaneous gesture\" and the manner in which the mother may respond to this or not, as it pertains to the generation of the \"false self.\" This probably has occurred several times in the book. Some of them are known to me: Alison\\'s coming out. The other\\'s took me some time to digest. An example would be the interaction between Alison and her mother, as she begins her drawing career. It seemed odd that her mother would seem to assist her, when her feelings on the \"coming out\" may have been mixed at inception. When Alison breaks down and hangs up on her, I guess this is an example of a \"rejection\" of the gesture. It does not seem so \"spontaneous\" but it could have been the case that Alison might have kept all of this to herself. The other instance would be the \"showing up\" at her mother\\'s performance, which seemed to fill her with dread, but ended surprisingly well in Alison\\'s opinion. Can her mother \"accept\" her appearance at the play, with her latest romantic interest in tow? \\n To be honest, I don\\'t see the need to \"like\" either Alison or her mother. The whole cast of characters is with rife asshole-dom and weirdness. The dead father makes me wonder how much of his behaviour was actually \"him\" or whether or not a predominate amount of his cranky douchebaggetry can be attributed to being unable to express himself a homosexual fashion. Much easier to be a father, a husband, in the family business than the dreaded unknown of being on societal fringes. \\n Alison\\'s mother, I give more of a pass to. The one book I seem to have clutched on, that I absolutely hated in high school was \"The Awakening.\" In my brain, it was \"rich white woman is unhappy, drowns in the lake like a dumb ass.\" Context matters, situations matter. Are/were women ever truly contented with their lots in life? Was there more there that they desired, but never deigned to explore? How much agency could they be afforded before hitting the wall of their own limits, or the world\\'s? \\n Still, the jarring fact that Alison\\'s diary that \"saved\" her in her youth probably was part of why she was so fucked up as an adult, with her mother willfully complicit in its implementation. It is almost as if her mother was saying to Alison \"happily accept your role as the familiar emotional dumping ground, and I will help you with your diary as compensation.\" Of course, Alison\\'s mother may not even know that that is what is effectively occurring, but there is nothing I can feel but some sort of sinister cog clicking in Alison\\'s mother\\'s mind as she does the diary, plays the \"crippled games,\" gives her financial support later in life. She is exchanging these things with some benefit in return. \\n Alison, good GOD. As soon as we start out in analyst/therapist sessions, I could do nothing but roll my fucking eyes. (More on this later). The explicit desire for acceptance made me puke. I don\\'t know why she even bothered; as if, her life would end if it was never given to her, but keep rolling the rock uphill, and then think that \"understanding\" would make things better. I think this book might have been an accurate attempt at understanding, whereas all the therapy/analysis nonsense seemed to be some sort of mechanism to find a formula to make things \"work\" in her brain. Throwing in the dream sequences was not as important as I thought it should be. I think there is too much attention paid to dreams for their symbolism. Somedays, yeah, you get chased by Godzilla in dreamland and it just does not mean shit in ther real world. Everyone seems to *want* the dreams to mean more than they do. They make for cool reading for two minutes, then get quickly forgotten when we see Alison attempt to fuck her life up more on the following page. \\n One thing I noticed about Alison is that it seems her mother probably is the cause of the \"mirroring\" effect Alison encounters in her romantic relationships. I think that \"transference,\" as in the sort Alison uses in the symbiotic labeling of \"beez\" to Eloise is probably the tip of the iceberg. It seems like the aloof, dispassionate manner with which Alison seems to address various romantic interests is probably her using her mother as a template. I cannot speak for Alison, but it seems really odd and weird and lazy to call romantic partners \"X,\" and \"Y,\" or whatever the fuck she did. The fuck? She feels fit to mention them, but not to elaborate on details, so they become these boxes on a page that \"X\" and \"Y\" will eventually read. In fairness, \"X,\" and \"Y\" might have done her dirty or maybe Alison took an oath not to mention them in her work ever and is being true to that. It still feels weird. I guess Eloise and the others seems to be more worthy of a picture, a name, details. \\n In the end, all of this shit is about sex. Alison\\'s maladjusted upbringing has likely caused her a lifetime of sexual and romantic desperation to cope with. The last period Alison ever had probably was more consequentially than the 1-2 panels it was given. This is demonstrable proof that Alison will never be a mother, and Alison\\'s mother will now never have to be saddled with advising Alison on childrearing, relationships with the father; this is something they will never share and this is something that Alison\\'s mother had to have know once the \"closet\" discussion occurred. There will never be any opportunity to have to relive her life through her daughter in any way, shape, form. On the one hand, there may have been relief on Alison\\'s mother\\'s part, but now she gets to carve her way in life without being saddled with the same American family bullshit that other women had to. Was Alison\\'s mother jealous? Instead of being a mother, Alison is a lesbian with cats. More transference in the offing, no? I find that any person who goes out of the way not to be a parent, and that is a woman, inevitably seems to figure out some way to get a creature to act as a baby stand-in. \\n Now, the \"therapist\" issue. This is the part when I have to share a bit about my intolerant self. I am a black male. So, whenever I see \"therapist\" I think it is my ingrained wiring to see that as something that only the decadent white folk can afford. You know, the same way only white folks can \"afford\" to be serial killers or ride in boats. It seems odd to actually pay someone to sit there and listen to the shit you spew. You pay someone to listen to your problems and then lay out a labyrinthine explanation as to how this may explain that, or this is related to this. It seems totally stupid...in my past mind. \\n I have outgrown my distaste for \"therapy/analyst\" things. Psychological problems are real and do need to be addressed. They are not \"moral failings\" or \"stuff that white people like.\" These are not things you \"outmuscle\" or \"get over.\" Thinking of myself, and stepping outside of the book, I guess I am reacting to what I hate: people being paid to help others. I hate doctors. I feel like they poo-poo my problems. Are they being prejudiced when they see me? Is it me just making mountains out of molehills? Could both be true to varying ratios? Do I give a shit about the partitioning of this? Why should I have to care about it, since in the end this means that I will be doing/not-doing whatever I am told since I have no choice. This differs from Alison\\'s experience, as I do not recall whether or not this was something she sought out or something she was suggested. \\n I got very angry. Talking to someone to solve *your* problems. How utterly ridiculous. I got bothered by this: I don\\'t give a shit about other people, since in the end, I will be the only person around to repair myself, whether that effort fails or succeeds. Fuck you Alison. Why could you not be braver? Did you need your mother\\'s help for anything? Did you need to come out? Why can no one be brave enough to live out the lives they choose on their own? Must talk to the mother, the doctor, the therapist, the cats, put it on paper for the world to see. I was livid with her for what I perceived as the cowardice of not being able to abide within herself and not to tolerate all the bullshit she was given. And, as I think of it, the very fact her therapist said that she had all of this energy directed at her in this \"sponge\" role in the family, I felt a bit vindicated hearing someone fucking say that finally. \\n I hated Alison\\'s interaction with her analyst/therapists a lot. \"Are You My Mother?\" The title says to me that you are going to these people because you *want* them to be your mother. That stuck in my craw as soon as I saw the woman in the chair with the pen in her hand. It seems like a ridiculous game, where the people with psychological training get paid, while the people in the chair get a place think out loud. How much money did you blow for something that you will end up having to face on your own in the end? Stupid. Creepy analysts calling you \"adorable.\" That should have never happened. Ever. \\n It feels like all of the genius I felt I have been exposed to in her work seems seated in cowardice and transference. The comics, her relationships, her diary, her therapist. It is like Alison is just a passenger, with all of these things swirling around her. Oh, look at her girlfriend trying to initiate sex, she turns her down like an idiot so she can work in bed. What a dumbass. When Eloise tells her that she was attracted to someone else, could Alison not see that she was wanting Alison to fight for her...or to end things right there. Now they are all chummy and whatnot, but it seems to be made out that Eloise is the guilty party for straying away, even though Alison may not have offered much more than nicknames and late-night walks with the dog. \\n All this cursing aside, I really *like* this book. Given the \"meta\" status of it, you must begin by taking a leap and reading yourself, literally, into it. The book seems to be bothersome, probably because it *is* Alison. This work is literally telling you how to read her, though it must be taken with a grain of salt, may be uneven, highly articulated in some portions, slobbish and melodramatic in others. I think this book will make a great tool for introspection, so do not take what you read at its own value. It will not be that \"entertaining,\" I guarantee. Read for understanding, not enjoyment. I think it is 3 on the first read, but will probably be 5 if you re-read, apply self, and study Winnicot and others behind this.', '4,5 stars', \"One-punch Man is still funny as hell in its third volume!

Until I saw this graphic novel on NetGalley..and because I discovered recently that if I start reading graphic novels or short stories, the reading slump is going far away from me. \\n So this is how I started reading \"Anne of Green Gables\", the graphic novel. \\n At the beginning of the story we meet Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, an old couple of sister and brother. They were living in Avonlea, in a place caled \"Green Gables\". They also had an old lady neighbor called Rachel Lynde who was spying on them every time. \\n One day, Matthew went to bring an orphan boy home, because they needed help. But instead, a ginger-haired girl with freckles and green eyes awaited him. He had no choice but taking her instead. All the way home she kept talking about this and that, and Matthew listened to her. \\n The first reaction Marilla had was to be dissapointed that a girl came an not a boy as they planed. \\n She decided to keep her that night but to bring her back the next day.

If you like this genre of manga, I recommend you his works. \\n Uzumaki takes place in a town named Kurozu-cho, this town has a curse involving spirals, there are spirals everywhere. The main characters are a girl named Kirie Goshima and a boy named Shuichi Saito, and since the beginning of the manga we can see how the curse affects the people around them and all the citizens in general, causing them to become obsessed or paranoid about spirals. This curse causes strange changes in the town and in the people living in it, some die in horrible ways and the main characters will have to try to escape or to find a way to stop this curse. \\n Uzumaki is the first horror manga I've ever read, as I said before, I've read some one shots by Junji Ito, but it's a different experience to read a whole manga with a sequential story. At first I thought Uzumaki was a compilation of unrelated events, because there were random stories that started and ended in one chapter, but as the manga progresses, its more obvious that these events are related to one another and the link between them are the spirals. The story is intriguing and always keeps a mysterious atmosphere, making the reader wonder all the time what is happening, why and if the protagonists will be able to stop it. \\n The main characters are really relatable, they aren't perfect and they get frustrated, or take wrong decisions, they are totally normal people. The character design and drawings in general are really particular, they don't have the abnormal big eyes usually seen in mangas, they have a more realistic look, and the style of Junji Ito is easy to recognize. \\n I must say that to me the story was good until the end, I actually got confused in the finale and the explanation of the spiral curse wasn't clear enough or conclusive enough to me, but I suppose it's part of the charm of this manga, is mysterious till the end. \\n If you want to read an intriguing story full of strange events and inexplicable things, this manga if for you.

The updates to the Riverdale universe are completely appropriate--as in they don't sacrifice the heart of the original story by making it more relevant for our times. The updates are more about giving consequences to actions that spread across issues, giving the characters deeper motivations (I especially love Jughead's backstory in this revival). But the funny, sweet things that made Archie Archie, are still around. He's still a horrible klutz, he still has a crappy car, and he's still caught up between Betty and Veronica. Only now, that indecision of love has a lot more believability than it ever did during my youth. \\n I can't wait for the next book to come to my library!\", 'I read this in one sitting. I\\'m definitely purchasing this as the copy I read was checked out.

Is anything sadder than cystic fibrosis in a little kid? The scenery was gorgeous and the character development pretty good given that it was a graphic novel with kids as the main characters.

Her attitude to society is having to portray it through satire. In the book, she explains the most irritating people types, what Robert Gustafsson, a comedian, contributes to the evolution theory, why Niklas Stromstedt, a musician, has to be with every female announcer on channel four and a future perspective of why Moderaterna, the rich wing political party, died out. \\n Compared to some of her other books, it is not as sharp and witty. Never the less, it's definitely interesting.\", \"Like Cyclops and Magneto, Storm is the latest X-Man to get her own solo series - and it's not bad! \\n There's no real story arc here, just several one-shots and a two-parter at the end. Storm deflects a tsunami, saving a small island nation from devastation; looks for runaways in Noo Yawk; works with Forge to set up an irrigation system in an African village; and helps an old Wolverine character, Yukio, maintain her power over some underground gangs. \\n The first story about the tsunami, and the evil paramilitary organisation Storm decides to beat up, was definitely the best. It instantly showed you how powerful a character she is and how grossly under-used she is in the ensemble titles she appears in. Greg Pak writes her character well so we see the person behind the superhero as well - it's a very humanising portrayal. \\n And that's essentially what this book is: a character sketch, rather than a story-driven comic. The second issue has the best couples' scene with Storm and Wolverine on a dinner date. Seeing this statuesque woman towering over this short, brawny man and the two making lovey faces at each other was so sweet, not to mention convincing - full credit to Victor Ibanez for his excellent artwork. I loved that panel afterwards when Wolverine leaves her and it's raining outside except for wherever Wolverine walks and he looks up and smiles; that one panel sums up their relationship and makes it more real to the reader. \\n The third issue with Forge in Africa also has the single best explanation for Storm's powers that I've ever read. She's essentially a weather witch who can do whatever she wants with the elements. You might ask yourself, why doesn't she solve drought in places like Africa, full stop? And then you read her reasoning for how her powers work and ooohhh, that actually makes sense! Kudos to Greg Pak! \\n These moments here and there are really nice to see but the stories themselves go from good at the start to disappointingly boring by the end. And that's the thing with character portraits is that the lack of story can occasionally make the overall book suffer. Storm looking for runaways ties into her character's past (she was an orphan in Cairo) but doesn't make for a terribly thrilling issue. She and Forge work together to help an African village have fresh water - eh... not a very engaging read. And that two-parter at the end with Yukio was just nonsense - an exercise in flexing to show strength and nothing more. \\n Ultimately Storm, Volume 1: Make it Rain doesn't leave much of an impression because of the directionless nature of the book - there's no story arc here and doesn't seem to be one being hinted at for later books either so it's not very memorable. And while it's a decent character portrait, Pak doesn't tell us a whole lot that isn't already known about the character. That is, unless you're completely unfamiliar with her in which case you'll walk away from this comic knowing quite a bit about Storm. Even then, despite Pak's efforts to make her a more rounded character, she still seems a bit too distant for the reader to feel close to. \\n Storm fans will love it because it's all Storm, all the time, but I think, while it has its moments, Make It Rain is just an ok comic overall. A stronger, more focused plot would've pushed this over the top.\", \"I really enjoyed some of these titles, others just felt TLDR, mayhap I just wasn't in the mood for this.\", 'I found the older comics a bit dated in storyline and the artwork. It was nice to get some of James \"Logan\" Howlett\\'s backstory, all the same. It was really interesting to discover that Wolverine\\'s first appearance was in The Incredible Hulk. Seeing these two guys throw down is quite an experience. \\n I\\'m having to be honest and say I can\\'t stand Mariko. Definitely not worthy of Wolverine\\'s pining. I couldn\\'t help comparing this as I read to the most recent Wolverine movie, \"The Wolverine,\" which I love, except for a few aspects. I think I prefer the movie versions of both Mariko and Yukio. Yukio wasn\\'t bad, but I didn\\'t like how she was so moony over Wolverine. I did like how kickbutt she was and kind of edgy. All the ninja stuff was cool (as they always are). I think Wolverine\\'s adventures in Japan shape him in pivotal ways, and I feel that it helps to temper his animalistic nature. \\n Wolverine will always stand out as an antihero who is quite heroic. He learns through the School of Hard Knocks how to use his healing factor, formidable strength, and lethal fighting skills, not to mention his adamantium claws to best advantage. \\n Rereading \"Weapon X\" brings to mind why Logan is so conflicted as a character. How they deliberately and ruthlessly tortured him to bring out that aspect, and why he will always struggle against it now. And that makes him even more admirable that he can temper his berserker rage to fight with the X-Men and others on the side of justice. \\n If you\\'re newer to the Marvel Verse, and want to find out the origins of Wolverine, this is worth tracking down. Just keep in mind that some of the older stories are from a different era, and frankly, like the sophistication of modern graphic novels. However, \"Weapon X\" is not to be missed by anyone who is intrigued with Wolverine. \\n 3.5/5.0 stars.', 'Strange, bizzare and entertaining.', 'I really enjoyed this book.

It looks great, of course, and the story, written by Dave Gibbons, remains one of the better Aliens comic stories, strengthened throughout by early Mignola art that does much to lend weight to the words and scenes.

This was enjoyable enough but nothing special.\", \"In celebration of the 50 YEARS OF COMICS EXISTENCE FOR THE X-MEN, this Gold issue #1 aimed to showcase the best aspects that there is to love about the X-Men. The stories featured herein were written by Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, Louis Simonson, Roy Thomas, Len Wein and Fabien Nicieza. They have all contributed substantially enough in the X-Men universe way back so it was nice to read their material again albeit in the form of flash fictions. \\n The five stories themselves were whimsical and kooky which is just the way I like them. Nothing too heavy but there is some lightness to be had particularly with that Stan Lee/Louis Simonson piece about the original X-Men and their very stilted sixties language that made me giggle non-stop because of how cheesy they used to sound like back then. \\n The longest story here had to be Claremont's Sentinels piece where we get to see the old-continuity X-Men before all the scary shit about mutant decimation occurred so it's pre-House of M era and we get fantastic character moments with Kitty Pryde and Rogue who had just become a part of the X-Men after being Mystique's sidekick for a while. Prof X and Scott are having happy times with their girlfriends here (alien empress Lilandra and Madelyn Pryor) while Nightcrawler is still very much alive (OH, I'VE MISSED YOU, ELF!). I hate anything with Sentinels but this story was acceptable enough. It was colorful and flashy and reminded you of the times when the X-Men can still enjoy themselves while doing good instead of worrying about their survival against hatemongering assholes like the current storylines we have now. \\n The other two pieces were delightful oneshots that feature the perspective of certain characters. The Roy Thomas one was about Banshee and Sunfire totally bro-ing it up with their little adventure. Meanwhile, Len Wein's Wolverine-focused piece was absolutely hilarious. The way that dude thinks can be so outrageous yet endearing all at once. Of course, the last piece of this issue was the only one that ended up unraveling me by the seams...then drove me bat-shit insane. \\n Yes, the greatest surprise in this issue for me was the fact that we even got a Professor X/Magneto story! And of course it was penned by Fabian Nicieza himself! If you don't know who this jerk is, then please refer to his nineties stories \\n Fatal Attractions \\n and \\n Legion Quest \\n which are both tales of Cherik-centered madness and shippy angstiness that would render any Charles/Erik shipper such as myself angry, tearful and comatosed because of Nicieza's paradoxical pleasurable and agonizing depiction of these two dorks' relationship. \\n I don't even know where to start so I'll just go ahead and stumble my way into reviewing this Cherik piece as sporadically and unapologetically crazy as I could and I don't care what y'all party-poopers have to say about it. Because, you fucks, I HAVE NOT CHERIK-ED FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS NOW! This is my time in limelight epic slashiness again, okay? Now, what got the blood in my lady-boner richly flowing again was this amusing reference to the actual 2011 movie adaptation of X-Men: First Class starring the most orgasmic pairing of Charles and Erik ever conceived in cinematic form, as portrayed by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. \\n And just as I was just enjoying that throwback, panty-melting acknowledgment of the 2011 movie's concept where Charles and Erik put a stop to Cold War simply by the power of their intense eye-sexing and unmistakable subtext (my personal interpretation you don't have to validate at all), this FUCKING FUCKITY FUCK SHIT HAPPENS! \\n This fucking fuckity shit left me in a blind rage. I mean, the piece was only five pages short! AND IT WAS AN ECHO TO THAT FUCKING FATAL ATTRACTION STORYLINE after all! The concept behind this piece, I believe, is essentially an illusion leading to Professor X mind-wiping Magneto after Mags almost killed Wolverine in the most horrendous way possible. You can view that clusterfuck here. For a second I thought I was getting Magneto's 'grief piece' at last because Marvel hasn't addressed WHY MAGNETO SEEMED ENTIRELY DISMISSIVE OF THE FACT THAT CYCLOPS JUST MURDERED PROFESSOR X! I just don't understand why we never got to see him grieve in some Claremont-esque manner where he'll be drinking scotch as he morosely looks at pictures of Charles back in the good old days, monologue-ing about how they could have had it all, etc. That's been a canon-established characterization of him for years! \\n Why can't you give me that back, Marvel, when I ask so little from you?! JERKS!!! \\n ANYWAY. Let's break down all their scenes and interpret the meanings of them, shall we? Or you can just scroll down and ignore me fangasming here. Either way, the deconstruction of Cherik is happening whether you are a willing participant or not!! \\n FIRST: We have this beautiful fantasy that Charles cultivated in Erik's mind for a while before he rendered him comatosed (how very cruel and affectionate all at once, Chuck). In this telepathic projection, we see Charles and Erik are united as partners and maybe even leaders of a new world, enjoying the fruits of their labor where mutant co-existence with humans was finally achieved. This scene of Charles fixing his tie in front of the mirror while scolding Erik for his bad behavior sounded to me like they are totes married now, living together like they did in Genosha, and are simply having married-couple conversation about the daily grind. That's how I interpreted it. \\n And then the husbands leave together from their idyllic home with a scenic view: \\n And just when I thought this was going to be a fluff piece, Logan started acting weird and grabbed Magnus who wasn't sure what was happening. But then Nicieza dropped the act abruptly and revealed that this was all a telepathic projection that Charles aimed at Magnus right before he severely mind-wiped him. Why did he do it? Well, Magnus just happened to RIP THE FUCKING ADAMANTIUM STEEL from Wolverine which explained why Logan was depicted with those weird things on his face and he looked to be in tremendous pain. \\n In a very Cherik manner of heartbreak, Charles holds Magnus close to him and says these tearful words: \\n ...all the while Adele's Rolling in the Deep plays in the background. How many times have we seen a scene of the two of them in each other's arms, always breaking up or dying? As hurtful as it is, I'm going to miss them doing this signature scene, now that Professor X is presently deceased since 2012. That being said, Marvel, I would still like to ask you kindly.... \\n ...WHAT IN THE OBLIVIOUS SHITE IS THIS FROZEN STRAWBERRY FUCK-UP? \\n The floodgates are now open. I have buried Cherik like an unpleasant memory because I want to abstain from Cherikking at least until the next movie comes out next year but thanks to this Nicieza piece, I'm once again reminded how much I love these two jerkwads who just have the worst timing in the history of couples getting-together ever! GOD..FUCKING..DAMMIT..SHIT..CUNT...ASDFGHJKL!!!! \\n *incoherent, bile-inducing rage and meltdown* \\n I'm also re-reading Subtitulor's amazing fanfiction \\n Nine Eleven Ten \\n in the meantime. BECAUSE I'M A MASOCHIST. \\n RECOMMENDED: 8/10 \\n DO READ MY REVIEWS AT:\", 'This really wasn\\'t what I was expecting. The recent Iron man movies depict an entirely different character. Robert Downy Jr\\'s Tony Stark is cocky, annoying and a little repulsive. The Iron man in here is cocky, introspective and completely compelling. I\\'m glad of it too because it meant the entire plot was character driven. \\n >The character 4.5/5- Tony Stark knows exactly what he is: he knows that his inventions have caused countless deaths. Thankfully, he isn\\'t in denial about the simple truth. He sees himself for what he is. However, to offset such corruption, he is also a superhero. But that\\'s not overly important. What matter sis that Tony Stark wants to change the world; he wants to improve the human race through the development of technology rather than war machines. \\n So he is very aware of himself, and his potential to help others. But he needs money. That means to get money he needs to sell weapons. It\\'s kind of ironic. In order to help the world, he must also create more chaos. Therefore, he isn\\'t completely good. On a morality scale I think he is distinctively neutral. He\\'s prepared to kill too. Those that are terrorists deserve no mercy in his eyes. He will do what\\'s necessary without a second thought, which makes him stand out when compared to the other avengers. His battle with his doppelganger delivered this, which bring me onto my next point. \\n >The Artwork 4/5- This was great; it really helped to deliver the speed of the actin. There were entire spreads without captions, which made the fights feel brutal and quick: \\n I love the effects. Some of it felt realistic, and almost of a cinematic quality. It\\'s full of life. It\\'s by far some of the best action scene renditions I\\'ve seen in a comic so far. It came across with bloody efficiency. \\n >The Story 4/5- The plot was intense. Tony is fighting an enraged terrorist who has stolen a biochemical formula similar to Captain America\\'s \"super solider serum.\" So the stakes were rather high. He initially defeats Iron man with absolute ease but Iron man comes to even the scales with some of his own serum and some armour upgrades. As the action ensues, Tony takes one good hard look at himself and realises who he is; he sees the nature of what is happening, and how he is being tested. He learns what he needs to do, and what he needs to become. This was a great. I actually want to read more. \\n Final Verdict-4/5', \"You know you're obsessed with Outlander when you start hunting down the graphic novel and assorted short stories just to find extraneous moments with characters. I didn't expect much of the graphic novel, but it was quite a lovely thing. At least at the beginning, the characters were well rendered. Unfortunately, after the 2nd chapter they get progressively more and more cartoonish, which I thought detracted from the excellent start! The story told from Murtagh's perspective added another view of the familiar narrative, and a couple sub-plots (i.e. Geillis and Kenneth)added some interest. Since I'm presently writing a novel telling the story of Grace Awakening from the perspective of a different character, it's interesting to see how it worked in Gabaldon's case. Quite enjoyable. Worth adding to the shelf if you like the Outlander series.\", '*4.5*', \"Yorumun asli --> https://yaprakonur.wordpress.com/2016... \\n Dun gece okudugum kitabi bitirip de hala uykuya dalamayinca Sandman'i aldim elime, Dusler Lordu kesesinden kumlarini cikarip gozlerime serpistirsin diye... \\n Ama sonuc bekledigimden farkli oldu, beni kendi ruyalar alemime goturmek yerine Neil Gaiman'in duslerinde bir yolculuga cikardi Sandman ve ilk cilt Preludler & Nokturnler'i bitirmekle kalmadim uzerine ikinci cilt Bebek Evini de yariladim. \\n Sandman'in adini cok duymussam da kendisiyle yeni tanisiyorduk; bu tanisma o aciz durumdayken oldu ve hikaye onun tekrar gucune kavusmasini anlatti.

When I popped into the library yesterday with my partner I came upon a treasure of a picture book. Now called graphic novels or stories that are written for adults, The Night Book Mobile is a serial that ran in the newspapers transformed into a book that can be enjoyed in its entirety and enjoy it I did. \\n The story itself has dark undertones that make the book definitely for an adult audience, but the concept is one that can be loved and understood by anyone who loves books. I am an addict and proud so when reading about Alexandra and her journey through reading and through finding the Night Bookmobile I had that sort of excited and almost thrilling high as I devoured the story and its beautiful pictures in less than half an hour. I mean, who wouldn't love to escape to a place where all the books you have ever read in your life are all in one place? Who wouldn't love to sit there, sipping tea and travel down memory lane, from the picture books to the intense thrillers to even your own journals written as a child through to adulthood? Count me in. \\n But there was a catch, and that catch had me feeling anguish for Alexander and I was seriously in a panic; which to me is what makes the ending of this book and her reality even more sensational to read. The artwork was simplistic, not overdone but still enjoyable. Not the greatest, but I still loved looking at it and I would certainly recommend this book to all avid book readers as it would be the perfect gift and the perfect addition to any Night Bookmobile of anyone's imagination. However with an ending like that, even though I did enjoy it I have to say it might have cost it a star. \\n I am giving this one: \\n Free mugs of tea from Dusk till Dawn\", 'A', 'I don\\'t go in much for the mega-events in mainstream comics. Back in the day - you know, we\\'re talking over twenty years ago - I was alternately enamored and repulsed by the huge cross-over events that the two comic book publishing giants spewed out. Crisis on Infinite Earths was a detailed and dramatic event worthy of the paper that it was printed on, but that Secret War nonsense was just downright painful. (The only two good things to come out of that were Spidey\\'s black-and-white alien costume, and the replacement of the Thing with She-Hulk on the Fantastic Four. But that\\'s about where my geekish inner fan-boy ends his gushing.) \\n Marvel\\'s merry mutants have had their fair share of cross-pollinating cross-overs since then - and typically one every year or so. Most of which I\\'ve managed to completely ignore. However, with my obsession with all things Ed Brubaker, I\\'ve turned my head back to the Uncanny X-Men - on which he\\'s been the writer for at least the past year. (In recent issues, Matt Fraction has usurped these duties.) Just before its five-hundredth issue - Can you believe it has been going this strong for so many years? - the X-Men, long-since separated into various teams, have banded together to rescue the last known mutant birth since the event referred to as M-Day, in which the Scarlet Witch wiped clean the X-gene from nearly every single mutant on Earth. \\n Of course, the remaining powered mutants - most of whom are X-Men, its allies, or enemies - are scrambling to not just pick up the pieces, but also to protect this last known mutant birth from falling into the hands of Mr. Sinister. (Shades of Children of Men, anyone?) And as these things usually go in the Days of Future Past motif (originated in the X-Universe all so many years ago), two members of the current roster - the mysterious Layla and Jamie Maddrox -- travel eighty years into the future to determine the significance and fate of this special child. \\n Although many plot-threads are left untied - typical for this genre, as it allows later writers to elaborate and reinvent the X-Men for later generations of readers - I did find it surprisingly exhilarating to watch events unfold. I may not be a huge fan of Mike Carey, the lead writer of all things X-Men in recent years, but I was surprised to see that the awful crap that was pumped out by Marvel in the 90s is long gone. ( And I proudly declare that I wasn\\'t following any of that, although I did notice the spike in speculative sales when Marvel - and DC, for that matter - became virtual puppy mills as they printed in huge volumes their ludicrous \"special edition variant\" lenticular covers. Usually drawn by my nemesis, Rob Liefield. Ack.) \\n X-Men: Messiah Complex is not too shabby a plot-line - despite some slightly irritating art.

I have been a card carrying comic book collector for over 32 years now without stopping. I have collected Marvel and DC superhero comics books such as Avengers, Daredevil, Captain America, Justice League, and Superman back to the 1960s. But I never knew much about the history of the golden age of comics from the 1940s and 1950s. \\n This book tells a great story about the creators of the golden age comics. Comic books were the main source of entertainment for kids back then before TV and a billion other forms of online streaming entertainment. A kid would buy a comic for just a dime and share it with all his friends. Stories were raw and uncensored and included genres of crime, horror, romance, westerns, and more. \\n But in the early 1950s several influential people began speaking out against comics. Comics were believed to cause juvenile delinquency. Horrible crimes such as murder and attacks on other children were blamed on ideas that they got from reading comics. Comics were collected a burned and kids were told to denounce comics because parents said comics were bad for them. The world and comic books changed. \\n As a comic book nerd I loved reading this book and I give it five out of five stars. Why, because it gave me a whole new appreciation for comic books and where they came from. There are several detailed accounts about comic book publishers such as Lev Gleason and his Crime Does Not Pay crime comics and the amazing EC Comics titles. I have now begun seeking out some of these golden age comics and find them a refreshingly new way of enjoying collecting and reading comics. Superhero comics and now movie and TV shows may be all the rave now but there was a world of comic book stories, publishers, and artists that created the true golden age of comics long, long, ago.', '1.) This is a great primary book because it is nonfiction in that it teaches about fire-fighters and fire stations, but it focuses more on descriptive pictures rather than descriptive words. The plot is very easy to following because it goes in order from when the alarm goes off to when the firefighters arrive at the fire. The whole book is about one topic and this makes it very easy for students to follow. The pictures and the words match which allows the story to flow from one page to the next. I do not believe that the panels are too busy. \\n 2.) During Fire Safety Month, I enjoy reading about firefighters and having firefighters come visit our classroom. This graphic novel would be great support and variety to go along with this activity. I could use this with my Kindergarten students as both a read-aloud and a book in their reading station to read independently. \\n 3.) This book is simple and has good illustrations to show students a day in the life of a firefighter.', 'Incredible. Simply amazing...', \"I got an ARC in return for an honest review on NetGalley. \\n I requested this comic because the few manga and comics I had read about ghosts that involved relationships had always been really interesting. This is top three of all the ghost books, comics, or manga I have read. It was that good. \\n The book focuses on the relationship between Blue and Hamal. Blue is a ghost that follows Hamal around. They became close after Blue died because Hamal was the only person around that could see ghosts. Blue and Hamal are surrounded by random other ghosts, which can cause issues for Hamal. \\n The story was so sweet. I was getting so worried when the major conflict of the book started. There was so much world that hadn't been explained yet that anything could happen. Blue and Hamal don't know how things work so the world wasn't explained. It was a great build up. As they learned things or didn't learn things, the reader did. It kept me guessing and it kept me enthralled. The lore of ghosts is so different between authors that I didn't know where to go. \\n I loved the cutesy art. This is one of my favorite styles when it comes to part romance, part supernatural comics, manga, and graphic novels. I don't know why. The cuteness helps soften the blow of the horror. There isn't a focus on blood and gore with this style. Things seem more believable for some reason. Whatever it is, I love it. \\n 5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend this book. \\n For more reviews check out mibookreviews.wordpress.com\", 'I love Sandman!!!', '** spoiler alert ** \\n Adult full-color graphic novel. \\n This graphic novel was originally published as three separate comic magazines. The first chapter takes place in Egypt, out in the Sahara Desert in \"the mirage city,\" in England and in Vienna. The second and third chapters mostly take place in the mirage city. \\n The first chapter opens with a ritual in Egypt, specifically in the pyramid of Cheops. A naked blond virgin is lead into the chamber. An Egyptian woman, with a forked tongue, examines the woman, and then shoves a long green snake into the blond woman\\'s anus. Out comes some strange glow from the blond woman, a mummy awakens, orgy time. Later the action moves to the Sahara desert, to a mirage city. More orgy, and then it appears that the Egyptians plan on raising another mummy, Set, and they use magic to determine which woman\\'s body Set will inhabit. The woman that they need to find? Lilian (from the two previous books). \\n The action switches over to Vienna where Lilian is in a session with Sigmund Freud (\"No, Doctor Freud . . . . I have no sexual fantasies, only memories\"). And just as we were entering this session, the scene shifts again. \\n The scene shifts to England, specifically 221 Baker Street London. Agatha is staying with a Mr. Holmes, who appears to be addicted to opium. Agatha is trying to get him to stop by distracting him with her body. \\n And now back to Vienna. While Lilian is under the effects of a tranquilizer, Freud examines Lilian\\'s sexual organs. Annoyed, Lilian flees into the night and is captured by some strange winged men and carried to Egypt, and end chapter one. \\n Chapter two: Lilian is carried to Egypt, and Agatha dreams that Lilian is in trouble, and so Agatha and Holmes head to Egypt. Orgies abound, and at one point, while wandering around a palace, Lilian uses her magic to turn a eunuch back into a fully-functioning man. More orgy, and Lilian becomes Set. End chapter two. \\n Chapter three: Lilian is now Set and Agatha tries to help set Lilian free from the possession. Agatha runs into a fellow witch who helps her. Agatha is placed in bondage gear and sold to the palace so that she might try to find Lilian and help her. The Prince is very picky about whom he will allow as entertainment, and many end up with the heads cut off, and this is the man Agatha is brought before. \\n Overall, the drawing is good, but at times the earlier black & white nature of the drawing leaks through, and destroys some of the artwork. This book is weaker than the two previous volumes. The book contains death, bondage, whipping, and more.', 'I stopped reading at a certain point because it was just... too much. And not in a \"this is kind of dark and gruesome\" way, but in a \"I can\\'t believe that character just died like that, are you kidding me\" kind of way. \\n Oh my love, how we must have faith-- SMASH. Like, really? She just... gets squashed by an effin\\' enormous cross? Just like that? From the freakin\\' ceiling, it just. COME ON. \\n So yeah. Probably not going to read more of this series.', 'Different creative team each volume which has kept the series fresh. Again, more vignette style but with a through theme. \\n Next volume is post-Secret Wars, so it will be interesting to see where they take the character and if they incorporate him more in the Marvel Universe.', \"This book left me wanting more, more about Marjane's life in France, more about her family, her ongoing understanding of her culture and how to incorporate it into her life as a European woman. I have a huge crush on Marjane Satrapi!\", \"Ancient history is right. This volume collects three story arcs--the origin story of Arseface, the origin story of the Saint of Killers and a riff on the action movie featuring Jody and T.C. \\n My favorite story arc by far is that of the Saint of Killers. This story comes into play in future volumes so it is the closest to the main story arc of Preacher. \\n Arseface's origin is also a great read. I think Ennis does a fantastic job of humanizing one of the most ridiculous-looking characters in this series. It really adds depth to the character. \\n Good Ol' Boys is just a fun yarn and it's alright. Not my favorite but enjoyable nonetheless. This will be especially welcome by those who thought Jody didn't get enough panel space.\", 'Typically, I cannot stand the art of Richard Corben. It reminds me too closely of Harvey Pekar and Harry Crumb, which, to me, have no place in the art galleries of Hellboy & B.R.P.D. However, in this such instance, the story was compelling and every so often a glimpse of a good-looking Hellboy would pop into a panel. Otherwise, most the characters look kind of dreadful to me. I get over it, though. And just accept it. I just really prefer the art of Mike Mignola, Duncan Fegredo, Guy Davis, and even Jason Shawn Alexander suits the material much more appropriately. But Mignola seems to like Corben, so there\\'s no way around it. Overall, a great book, great read. I give it only 4 stars because of Corben\\'s art for \"The Crooked Man.\" Everything else represents Hellboy/B.P.R.D. very well.', \"JSA (Justice Society of America) Presents: Green Lantern is a collection of crummy comics nobody asked for featuring Alan Scott, the Golden Age Green Lantern.

Wanker. \\n Green Lantern fights Solomon Grundy (crap DC proto-Hulk) a lot, as well as some Nazis because WW2, and finally Vandal Savage in a Thanksgiving Parade. Some guy who was once a friend or maybe an enemy Dials H for Hero and turns into a dumbass. Bah! \\n The book is full of corny writing and bad art and my brain already knows to forget this garbage in the next few minutes.

I can tell things are gonna get pretty bad yet exciting on the next volume!', \"Delisle is one of the greatest graphic novel journalists of all time, a master at giving a feel for the locations where he and his wife live and helping us understand the culture, all the while amusing us with his own personal narrative of life events, mostly small but occasionally big. In this book, in frame after similar frame, we experience the culture of being a hostage. It's exactly how you would expect: boredom, frustration, discomfort and anxiety punctuated by moments of adrenaline. But mostly long stretches where nothing happens. \\n There's no link here to the broader context of what's happening, no attempt to understand (or vilify) the hostage takers, no view of broader role the protagonists employer (an NGO) plays in the region. \\n The second star in my rating is because while the subject matter and narrative are fully unexceptional, Delisle portrays it masterfully. Viewed as a stylized document of what the hostage went through, there's nothing to be faulted here. Viewed as a rewarding or enlightening reading experience, there's nothing to be found here.\", \"Cool but didn't resonate for me.\", \"I have never played Dungeons and Dragons but I always liked the franchise.

Heroes from Baldur's Gate are transported to Ravenloft to confront its evil denizens and their master, the vampire Baron Von Strahd. I pretty much read this on a whim, but it turned out to be a very good read. The art is a little cartoony for a Ravenloft story, but still wasn't bad. \\n Overall if you like D&D comics, you'll probably enjoy this one, especially if you like Ravenloft.\", '** spoiler alert ** \\n I did love this volume but with a good conscience, I couldn\\'t give it 5 stars because the ending was too open and nothing was really solved. Sure, we did find out that Watanuki\\'s powers got so strong that he could leave the shop again and there were some small revelations, like, that Himawari-chan got married, but that was pretty much it as the overall story went. Watanuki didn\\'t meet Yuko again and Domeki didn\\'t use the egg she had given him... The stand-alone stories were beautiful, though. \\n I think, and that\\'s just my opinion, that Watanuki didn\\'t meet Yuko-san ever again. She was dead and as she herself said, dead people couldn\\'t come back to life. I also think that Domeki never married and stayed with Watanuki. He sacrificed so much for his friend, after all, he went to study folklore because of him, he focused on helping Watanuki instead of working in his family temple, he kept refusing women who asked him out... I don\\'t think there ever was anything sexual between them, they just seemed like two halves of a whole. \\n Now that I\\'ve finished both series, \"Tsubasa Chronicle\" and \"xxxHolic\", I have to say I liked \"xxxHolic\" better.

I thought I knew enough about the comics industry in the post-WWII era. I was wrong. Due to the diligent investigative work by David Hajdu, I've learned the comic book burnings were much more prevalent and widespread than I'd thought. The legislation on the books against comics was also more widespread. Hajdu not only interviews cartoonists who worked in the industry then, he tracks down and interviews children who burned the books. \\n Starting before the beginning of the 20th century, when the first comic strips spoke to immigrants using slang, vulgar humor and thuggish violence, Hajdu traces the attempted suppression of comics from those strips to the reaction against crime comics and then, irrationally, a reaction against nearly ALL comics. It's not surprising the worst of the wrath happened during the time of McCarthy. Hajdu documents it all with not only facts and figures but also observations of sly wit. \\n My only disappointment was that the book ended far too soon (the late '50s). At least one chapter on the effect of the Comics Code Authority in the '60s and '70s, its waning influence and its mysterious ending days would have been not only helpful but practically necessary after hundreds of pages of building up to the CCA's implementation.\", 'This was cool, Blonde Widow vs. Red Widow, hair that is, both ladies are Black widow, this was the ultimate in Spy Comics', 'Set in 1954, Teddy Daniels and his partner are both FBI agents investigating a missing persons report on Shutter Island, a psychiatric facility for the criminally insane. The missing person is a mass murderer who has escaped the mental hospital on the island.

And what an ending! \\n The graphic novel is based on the book (not the film) written by Dennis Lehane. The muddy brown & yellows are thanks to French artist Christian De Metter. The art is important to the story, to convey the depravity and depression often associated with places like this. \\n I have not read the book nor seen the movie, so I can only assume the ending is the same. The panels are written out like a standard comic book, with no splash pages or excitement of a thrilling ending. The story plods along in some places - the parts with no dialogue and just pictures is especially interesting and leads you on a merry mind-bending chase. \\n If Dennis Lehane is making some kind of commentary on psychiatric methods, he\\'s doing a good job. Is it \"therapy\" to lock someone up, possibly for life, filling a patient with drugs and arcane and at times evaluative silly advice that does nothing to forward sanity? \\n Interesting subplots: Who is this girl that disappeared from her cell? Why are there guards around a \"sanitation facility?\" And what\\'s the meaning of a code found in the missing girl\\'s room?

After reading his Boxers And Saints series, I knew I wanted to read this book, since I've heard a lot of really good things about it. \\n We see three different stories in this graphic novel- Jin, Danny, and The Monkey King. I really liked The Monkey King's story, and I also really liked Jin's. I felt so bad for Jin when we first meet him in American Born Chinese, and how his classmates and teachers made assumptions about him. I also loved the story of The Monkey King, and I really want to know more about that story, because I really liked it. \\n Danny's story was my least favorite of the three. I still liked it, but...I'm not sure what it is about his story, but it just didn't appeal to me the way the others did. I wasn't sure how Danny fit into the book at first, because he seemed really entitled and I wasn't sure why his story was included for most of the book. It did become clear at the end, and I honestly didn't see it coming. Now that I think about it, I might re-read it, because knowing how all three stories connect would definitely help me see Danny's story in a completely different way. \\n One of my favorite things was how it all tied together, and I really liked how the book was about liking yourself and being true to yourself, no matter what. And I loved how well-plotted the book had to be, because everything was so detailed and thought out so well for everything to work together so well. I can't imagine American Born Chinese being told in any other format, and I think, if it were told more traditionally (i.e., a novel) it would lose something. Somehow, it works beautifully as a graphic novel. I think the illustrations are what really bring the book to life. \\n My Rating: 4 stars. Unfortunately, my initial dislike of Danny's story is what is lowering my rating of the book. Even though his story made more sense at the end of the book, it didn't work for me at the beginning. Still, American Born Chinese is a great read because it's a really good starting point for talking about a lot of different issues.\", 'First finished March 1, 2015', 'Enjoyed the mixed media of the art, along with the ghoulish presentation of different allegory.

I'm not convinced that author Engelhart had any idea of where he was going, and it sort of shows, particularly in the murky connections between the Squadron Supreme and Brand. \\n With that said, it's a wonderful mishmash too. Though they meander and muddle, these stories are epic. First, we get the last Kang story. (Ha!) Then we get the transformation of romance star Patsy Walker into superhero Hellcat. The Brand part of the story falls a bit short, but once we get to the Squadron's Earth we get a rather magnificent story of the Serpent Crown having taken over the whole planet (and the Squadron deciding to fight against it).

Unfortunately, Nick thinks Happy is a hallucination and is more concerned with dodging the Mafia thugs hunting him down. \\n Verdict: In this collection of the stand-alone four-issue series, Morrison offers a violent and profane redemption story that reads like a Garth Ennis work, without achieving Ennis's level of black comedy. Lacking that and Morrison's typical metafictional approach, Happy! is really carried by Robertson's art, which mixes the brutal with the surreal.

Because the synopsis sounded amazing and the art looked awesome. \\n I can only say that the comic exceeded my expectations. It was not what is thought I would be and I loved it for it. In this comic, we see the badass detective, Lady Mechanika, who is half human and half mechanical. Because this is a steampunk story it was, at first, a weird combination between 1800 victorian England and a more modern twist, with a lot of different mechanical things in it. Some things we have seen before and some things we differently don't have yet, especially not in the 1800 century. \\n The artwork was beautiful and dark. The story was good and made you want more. I love that there is more than one strong woman in this story. Plus even if the women is drawn a little sexual, with a lot of curves, they are still covered up. \\n There is a lot of action in this story and it is amazing. There is a element of suspense, thrill and mystery. A lot of twists and turns that kept me on the edge. All of this makes an amazing graphic novel and I can't wait to read the next volume. \\n So I can definitely recommend this graphic novel to you.

It isn't; it's a raw work, emotionally exhausting at times, though very effecting. Seeing often intangible emotions and psychologies in visual form makes this work accessable. There's no doubt the author has overcome a great deal- there is no sense of pity for her, only admiration at what she has worked to overcome. It's an honest look at many difficult subjects with a few moments of lightness to carry you through. \\n Because it is so personal I feel I ought to tread lightly. I did feel it was a bit long, repetitive at times with less than memorable dialogue. Ot could have swung into the realm of misery lit, but luckily it doesn't.

Trevor though knows that the mindset of the adults isn\\'t right at all. Trevor and Will along with others set out to free the creatures in hope of helping them see a world beyond the one that exists of only being chained up. \\n Freaks of the Heartland is incredibly easy on the eyes thanks to the artwork with a rustic color to it.

Drawing from her own experience as a child, the author/illustrator describes an event that typifies how her parents and neighbors endured those challenging times when even a visit to someone a couple of streets away could result in death from a sniper. When her parents are unable to return from a visit with her grandmother, Zeina and her brother wait in the foyer of their apartment building, one of the only safe spots left. One by one, their neighbors come by to chat, offer comfort, and share food with the children. All of these neighbors reveals heroic sides. The author uses only black and white panels to tell her story. It will be impossible for readers to forget the enterprising Chucri who risks his life to find Zeina's parents; the devoted Anhala, a family servant for three generations, left behind by those she served faithfully; and Ernest Challita who can quote entire passages of Cyrano de Bergerac from memory, to the delight of the children. These are the lives and everyday existences that form the basis of the stories about war and its long-reaching effects that need to be told.

The tales further expand on the beliefs and experiences of the Kansa tribe, and young Poika in particular as he prepares to leave boyhood behind. \\n This book, along with its predecessor, offers an incredible insight into the lives of our ancestors as they struggle for survival in an environment they know intimately but have little true understanding of. In turn this means they apply their own stories and anthropomorphic explanations to make sense of it all, and that mysticism and magic that then pervades their lives becomes infused in these stories. The result creates a slightly off-kilter form of storytelling that feels both close to nature and oddly disconnected from the real world. \\n Perhaps the most compelling example of this is the opening tale involving two sisters who are abducted by stars to become their lovers. Told during a gathering of tribes as a lesson to a group of gathered young woman it weaves myth and superstition with the expectations of those coming of age to create a cautionary tale. By seeing the world through the tribe's eyes we can better understand how religion and legend took hold of the imaginations of early people. \\n The crowning glory of these wonderfully crafted tales is the outstanding artwork of Adam Brockbank who brings a beautiful realism to early Britain, from the brutal hunts to the inter-tribal stresses, giving each and every character a distinct personality and every animal an intense realism that allows them to leap from the pages. \\n There are very few graphic novels out there that combines such imaginative storytelling with first-class art, so if you're after something refreshingly different that won't disappoint then this just has to be the book for you.\", 'Congressman John Lewis has been a key figure in several milestones of the Civil Rights Movement.

Perhaps Gone to Texas, the series' first volume, seemed much more shocking when it debuted back in 1995/6, before horror went Hostel and fiction pivoted so completely from the hero to the antihero. \\n Which is not to say there's not a fair share of blood and violence in Preacher, or that is shies away from potentially touchy religious themes, though I might argue that the idea of an absent God is not particularly original, as the concept of a deity that wound up our clockworks and then simply peaced out goes back at least to the 17th century (and probably a great deal further, but I'm too lazy to hunt a citation for that). Still, this introduction of Preacher Jesse Custer, who finds himself melded with a powerful religious entity known as Genesis, his complicated ex-girlfriend Tulip, and bystanding vampire Cassidy (whom I'm now convinced is the pattern for The Unwritten's Richard Savoy) lays a lot of groundwork for potentially challenging material. And given that there are far too few theologically themed Westerns in my life, I'm willing to at least see how Ennis develops the themes of this particular sermon.\", \"Why is it like this?

And quite often there was an added magical/fantasy/action aspect that drove me more (Star Blacks, Ageha 100%, Saint Tail, Miracle Girls...). Wait I\\'m dangerously off topic here. \\n So volume 2, after Ginta\\'s (not that surprising this is shoujo after all) confession to Miki is ALL the awkwardness for everyone but Yuu. Because Yuu is that freaking awesome. \\n Let me ruminate on Yuu in these early volumes since later it can get distressing to be his fan (from what I remember). He\\'s arrogant, selfish and likes to rile Miki up. He is not however deliberately cruel, two-faced or insensitive. Most of his issues with Miki (which are all HER issues with him, not the other way around) stem from their parents weird relationship and the fact he\\'s the opposite of Ginta in all ways. At one point this occurs: \\n Ginta: You make me sick to look at you! \\n Yuu: That\\'s funny, I don\\'t get sick when I look at you :walks away, turns around: But then you\\'re not worth wasting energy on. :leaves: \\n Miki, who is very direct and open, doesn\\'t really know how to handle someone like Yuu who casually teases her and doesn\\'t push his feelings/thoughts/actions onto her. I should point out that unlike a lot of the shoujo guys I remember reading (or watching) at the time, Yuu doesn\\'t spend half his conversations with or about Miki deriding her or treating her badly then in private agnst\\'ing his feelings and treatment of her. The occasional inscrutable look, cryptic remark or carefully indifferent \\'wanna hang out?\\' when she\\'s feeling down are pretty much his stock in trade. \\n Anyhow.

While some of it might be a bit confusing for those not familiar with the actual book, it was still done very well. The illustrations were amazing, especially the difference in Dorian the man and Dorian the portrait, as you can see on the book's cover. \\n Next up, we have the short story The Canterville Ghost, which was a personal favorite. The story was funny and nicely told in the format. It definitely made me wish to go and read the actual story, as well, which I think is a plus if these graphic novels can do that for other readers. \\n The third story was Lord Arthur Saville's Crime, which, again, was amusing in that classic Oscar Wilde way. The drawings for this story perfectly fit the narration, as it's a lot more dark. \\n Finally, this book ends with Salome, which was probably my least favorite out of the entire book. This is in no way because of the writing or art, but rather, the storyline in general didn't interest me as much as the rest. One of my favorite parts was the page where Salome dances. The artist took the various moves and poses and lumps them all together in a way that turned out amazing. I definitely think they were correct in using this for the end of the book, which made the set-up of all the stories nicely done. \\n Overall, OSCAR WILDE was an immense pleasure to read. The writers and artists took a hard task and did it well. I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde myself, though I haven't read much by him as of yet. I believe that this book will be welcome in the homes of new and old fans, as it gives you a first peek into some of Wilde's famous plays and stories, as well as showing them in a new, modern way. \\n By the time I was finished reading, I couldn't wait to read more by Wilde, as well as more Graphic Classics.\", \"3.5 stars, maybe? This graphic novel collection followed a whole bunch of Lost Islands, and it's fair to say that I enjoyed more than the first one (The Mystery Boxes). There was cool artwork, once again (Jason Caffoe, Chrystin Garland, Dave Roman and Raina Tegemeier, Michel Gagne, Katie and Steven Shanahan, and of course, Kazu Kibuishi). Further, the stories in this one made me a lot more invested in the story, specifically Garland's The Mask Dance . It was a fun ride!\", \"so maybe haruna's innocence is not strictly credible, but it's gorgeously funny, so i'm not complaining.\", 'A surprisingly moving story about hope and yearning in the context of immigration. The lack of words really forces the \"reader\" to try to apprehend what is happening without any understanding of the full intent or meaning behind the characters\\' body language. Of course, this puts the \"reader\" in the position of the main character, an immigrant who cannot understand the language of his new homeland and is unfamiliar with its customs. This creates a funny kind of reverse-metafiction that effectively puts the audience right in the middle of the story\\'s emotional \"space\". Tan\\'s customary baroque weirdness is on display as we \"hear\" the stories of several immigrants who encounter each other and tell their tales of how they arrived in this strange land, but Tan shows a greater restraint here than he does in Lost and Found. I prefer the outrageously imaginative art of Lost and Found to the sepia tone nostalgia of The Arrival, though the latter book does carry more emotional impact.', \"It's Bendis, so the characters are on point and the dialogue is sharp and funny. It's Marvel, so the plot was entirely hijacked by crossover chaos. \\n I'm an old geezer, and I have fond memories of Angela as she originally appeared in Spawn. I'm happy as a clam that Gaiman has the rights to Angela back, and that Marvel is using her. I have no idea why she's in GotG, her presence here is distracting and annoying. This is probably a preamble for a major retconning of the character. I have no real interest in seeing her changed from a celestial/metaphysical being into a member of yet another alien race that humans have mistaken for gods.\", \"I received an ARC of this title from the publisher via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review. \\n While I did have a handful of laugh-out-loud moments reading these comics, it fell flat of the genius that is the show. Surprisingly, I enjoyed Bob's sections the most; his burger name ideas made me giggle uncontrollably. Tina was a close second with her Erotic Friend Fiction, but even that got a little old after the fifth story. Usually Gene is the character that gets me the most, but his musical numbers did little for me. Maybe I need to hear it in his voice, rather than just imagine it in his voice to truly find it funny. I think it's possible that if I had spaced out my readings of the five issues found within, I would have enjoyed it more. Still - a solid three stars.\", 'NOTICE: I will be making many references to Narutaru. Can\\'t help making a joke about it and for all intents and purposes, this is a double review for both series. Damn things are practically the same anyway. Also, this is one of those weird retrospective texts that focuses more on what happens around a series that in it. If you don\\'t like it, it ain\\'t my fault. \\n PROLOGUE \\n Bokurano, aka Narutaru mk2. \\n Ok, the guy who makes these things clearly goes for impressions through shock value around children abuse. Where Narutaru was \"Let\\'s have kids being tortured and miserable, with Pokemon flavor\", Bokurano is \"Let\\'s have kids being tortured and miserable, with huge robots flavor\". In both cases, the critters or the robots don\\'t really play a role in the actual points the titles want to show. They are there for flavor, just like milk is to tea. Down to it, the only focus to both series is \"Torture kids, torture them more, and them kill them miserably.\" Sounds disgusting and vile, doesn\\'t it? Well, that\\'s what makes it so damn special. It\\'s like Ausvich in a way. You don\\'t care about the area, as much about the inhuman acts that took place there during the era where being blonde and blue-eyed was totally GAR. \\n [b] VALUE SECTION [/b] \\n Anyway, where Narutaru lacked an overall objective in its story and was mostly random arcs about kids in happy-go-lucky situations going from bad to worse, Bokurano actually tries to have one. \\n Saving the world with a huge robot! \\n ...Pretty lame-sounding, doesn\\'t it? What are we to like this premise, twelve year olds? \\n (EVA 01 stares angrily towards me) \\n Errr... What I meant is that it basically uses a childish concept as means of shock effect. And it works too. Imagine the Care Bears dancing happily around a tree and then suddenly the tree sprouts teeth, eats them, goes \"munch, munch\" and then spits out their bloody sculls. \\n ...Yeah, nice way to kill your childhood innocence. \\n Bokurano is similar. Just like its older brother used cute little critters, this one uses big robots. You think it\\'s going to be childish but then turns Happy Tree Friends ... without the humorous irony. \\n Does it work? Erm, yes, it works as shock value for sure. It really is GASP material the first time you watch it. The thing is, shock value is a one-time special ability. Just like any super attack in any shounen series, it only works once on each individual. The second time you try to use it, the opponent has a way to counter it, block it, negate it, or in the case of the viewer \"It\\'s not as shocking anymore!\" Therefore, it needs to have other elements to keep the viewer still interested in replying the whole mess. \\n ...And this is where it all falls down. \\n Narutaru was bad in this regard as the complete lack of general direction as a story meant that you have no reason for you to want to relive the whole mess. What is there to watch? Bokurano kinda fixed that problem by adding the objective of world salvation. Ok, now you can watch again the process of how they try to do it. \\n ...And it still fails. \\n Thus, Value is very low. (3) \\n STORY AND CHARACTER SECTION \\n You see, it\\'s not really about saving the world. It\\'s about kids in miserable situations. It\\'s like \"Wow, I will be dead soon; how will I spend my last hours alive?\" So you can pretty much screw the whole battle for the salvation of Earth. Although losing the battle automatically means that Earth will blow up, it\\'s not really the point at all. The robot battles are as I said flashy extras that serve very little to the actual plot. They do provide mystery as in many cases the cast tries to figure out what the hell is going on here, and in some other cases it does affect the story as the damage from the battles affects the lives of the rest of the world. All that unfortunately happens too rarely and in very convenient moments to actually feel natural in-story. For example, if someone is killed by a bad robot, he will be relative to the kid piloting the robot at the moment. \\n Practically, the story could easily be remade as individual arcs around the last moments of children with terminal diseases. You can take out the robots and the salvation of Earth and it would make almost no difference. What I mean is that although there are 14 kids that are supposed to be the main cast, the story always focuses on one or two at the most at any given time, leaving all the rest as background decoration, until their time to fight and/or die comes along. Now, I am not an ass to demand 14 characters being exposed at the very same time. But I do demand for all of them to be equally important to the story. They could for example do a Bacanno! type of non-linear story, where we see the same events happening all the time but through different perspective, each time from a different kid. We could have 1 battle with a bad robot in the whole series and each kid gets to fight it at the same time. That would make it concrete. But no, what we got was a singing contest. The kids were taking turns, waiting like drones for an invisible force to choose their turn and then all of a sudden they would be thrown in a dreadful situation where they are supposed to resolve it before fighting for the last time in their lives. \\n It works as shock value but at the same time it has no overall binding with the freaking setting of the story. Not to forget to mention all that political mambo-jumbo they threw in that serve as nothing else but detracting from the main themes of the series. Why have them if they make the story even sloppier than it already is? That translates to bad storytelling. It was bad in Narutaru; it tried to be better here but in fact it ain\\'t. \\n I must also point out that the anime version pulled the adaptation decay turd on us and changed the ending to be happy in a way. Well, duh, I prefer the sad and grim manga version far better. \\n Thus, Story and Characters are bad for not feeling natural to the viewer because of the lack in uniformity. (5) \\n And I know that a series is not supposed to be realistic, but come on, the story is supposed to be about contemporary Japan of today, normal kids of today, having normal lives of today. Excuse me for expecting some realism. Not in reactions to normal problems; it does a good job in its slice-of-life drama. I mean on a level of constant uniformity where they are main characters all the time and not for a few episodes when the scriptwriter decides out of the blue to throw in a \"The robot calls you to be the next pilot\" ass-pulling trope to turn their role from Kid12 to Main Hero. \\n Hm, what did I leave out? Ah, yes, Art. \\n ART SECTION \\n I won\\'t stick here much, sue me. The visuals on the robots are generally good. The character figures look simplistic and unappealing but that is not really a minus. If they were trendy shounen leads, they would be complete sh*t in the context of the story; so at least they save face where they lose it in character motivation. So good job there for a change. Cinematics for atmosphere built-up? Sure, they are ok. Ok, I must admit they did a very good job here, despite not WOWing me in any way. 8 for Art. \\n And for the final entry we have Enjoyment. Boy, so hard to excuse this part. \\n ENJOYMENT SECTION \\n I sure liked the controversial aspect of the series. It\\'s not really about kids piloting transforming robots and happy-go-lucky protect the planet from evil aliens. It is also thought-provoking in a way, as it does make you think and feel strange about the situations the kids are thrown in. \\n And now the nasty part. This series is based too much on shock value. It leaves you with a vivid impression because of the horrible things that happen in it. Yet at the same time, it has very little to back it up. The second time you try to watch it, you clearly see it ain\\'t so dramatic and the actual plot is peanuts. Also, the focus on character exposition is pretty amateur\\'s work, as most feel like stunts for most of the story until magically thrown to the position of Main Hero for the sake of... well, dying. Character exposition moments before dying? Talk about Newbie Errors 101. Too many characters, too little time invested on each, too many things befalling each one at once, making it unnatural. \\n I know most anime fans don\\'t care about that and as long as it shocked them it is considered a success. I on the other hand look at the bigger picture. Does it do it better than other stories with similar elements? Just think about the most famous titles that kinda remind you of Bokurano (and it ain\\'t Narutaru). \\n Alien Nine? Hm, maybe. \\n Elfen Lied? Far less characters and thus far more focus on each one of them. \\n Neon Genesis? Sorry, dwarfed big time. \\n Battle Royale? Ok, now it is invisible. \\n My, look at that, now it ain\\'t so special after all. It may rank on the better made but it still feels bad next to the titles it has similarities with. For all it maters, I admit it\\'s better than Narutaru. \\n ...Oh well, let\\'s give it the base and call it for the day; I feel generous today. \\n p.s. Here are some overall rating for Narutaru next to Bokurano. Just a last moment bonus and such... \\n Art: Narutaru:6, Bokurano:8 \\n Story: Narutaru:4, Bokurano:5 \\n Characters: Narutaru:5, Bokurano:5 \\n Value: Narutaru:3, Bokurano:3 \\n Enjoyment: Narutaru:4, Bokurano:5 \\n Average: Narutaru:4.5/10, Bokurano:5.5/10', '!Excelente!, sabia que no me decepcionaria.

On the last day of sunlight, the majority of the 563 inhabitants are flying elsewhere. Sheriff Eben Oleson's estranged wife, Stella, an Alaskan Fire Marshall, plans to leave but misses her flight due to unfortunate events. Eben has no plans to leave, he must remain and keep a watch over everyone and everything. He might have considered that an easy job, considering only 152 people will remain, but things start to go seriously wrong. First it's the burned cellphones, then someone's dogs are all killed. Power supplies are shut off. The creepy stranger locked up in the town's prison cell says that 'they' are coming. When Eben asks who they are, the stranger doesn't warn him that whatever 'they' are, they are not human. A gang of thirsty vampires are coming to town. \\n 30 Days of Night by Tim Lebbon (published 2007) is a book that has been written based on a movie, and screenplay by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson, rather than the more usual way of having a movie based on a book. For that reason, I guess, Lebbon's book follows the movie very closely except, as far as I can recall, a harrowing scene involving a polar bear. \\n Tim Lebbon wrote this 324 page book in third person omniscient which means that we get to experience the fear and thoughts of more than one character as well as the horrific events taking place in different places simultaneously. Lebbon is an award winning writer with a very easy-flowing writing style which enables a reader to keep up the pace of action. Thank goodness he didn't resort to the titillation of romantic scenes between estranged man and wife, Eben and Stella, getting back together. Such badly handled scenes have wrecked many a great thriller, book and movie. There's little romantic sentimentality in 30 Days of Night, just plenty of ghastly gore and tension. There is also wonderful characterization, descriptions of bravery, of sacrifice, of love of family. Lebbon makes the characters real. \\n 30 Days of Night is tense stuff and I cannot remember for the longest time a book engaging me so completely. Yet, I had to keep putting it down and go and do something else. I became so wrapped up in this story of survival in an inhospitable environment that I found myself getting wound up like the Town Hall clock (when Town Hall clocks were wound up). Even when I told myself that it is only a book of fiction, I could not disengage myself from the empathy I had for the remaining citizens of Barrow, those who braved the 30 sunless days and would certainly have got on the last plane out of there if they had known what was coming. I was counting the days with them, waiting for the sun to rise again. That, my friends, is a sign of a jolly good read. \\n Yes, there are plot holes if you look for them but they are not Tim Lebbon's plot holes; they existed in the movie: 30 Days of Night (2007). Sadly, I wasn't convinced by the ending, the last 15 pages or so. Implausible! screamed off the big screen and it shouted out loud from the book too. Again not Lebbon's fault. How can I put it without a spoiler? Ok, say throughout a novel humans turning into vampires all seem to do it the same way at the same rapid pace, and then along comes someone who seems to have superhuman control of the matter when no one else has had that control--well, you see, the point is, don't change the damn rules of vampiredom to fit the story. None of that twinkling either. Having said that, the ending still didn't ruin the book. \\n Was 30 Days of Night scary? Yes, if you are frightened by tales of horror. No, if you're not. Were the movie and book gripping, engaging, making you glad you don't live in Barrow? Absolutely. 30 Days of Night is a recommended reading for fans of horror and survival. \\n http://movies-and-books-world.blogspo...\", 'I give it two stars for the comedy.

There are two additional stories, one featuring a dog that I really liked and a kind of confusing one with Swamp Thing, but I liked the oddly named WeinWrightson Tower if only because it gives a nod to two greats we lost this year. \\n I liked the quick pacing, the wacky humor and the gorgeous art by David Finch, who did the art for most of the issues featured. The stories are also good as well. There is some surprisingly good humor involving the dog and a strange burger restaurant. \\n I received a review copy of this graphic novel from DC Entertainment and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this graphic novel.\", 'A fun adventure story with beautiful artwork.', \"This was one of my favorites in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist mangas. I loved the duel between Pandora *cough*Arcana*cough* and Yugi in the anime, so I was excited to read about it in this and I was not disappointed! If anything, it's better in the manga, as most things are. The best thing about it was that Yami isn't such a push-over and a pansy. He's a freakin' beast. \\n The duel between Jonouchi and Insector... eh. Most of Jonouchi's duels are boring, so I can't say it was surprising.\", \"So far I'm not terribly keen on the artwork compared to Hellchild and Van Helsing Vs Dracula, but we'll see how the plot goes for now.\", \"I think that one thing I'd say about this series is that after a while it becomes something that is better in small doses. This volume veers off from the more cute elements introduced in volumes one and two, which makes it a little harder to read after you've just finished the previous volumes. Tobina tries to take a more serious tone in this volume and after a while it just felt like it dragged more than thrilled. \\n Now don't get me wrong. This is the time when more serious plot points should be brought in and family drama is the most likely candidate for this series since it doesn't seem to want to be an action manga. I just can't help but occasionally feel a little bored with the family drama, especially since so much of it centers on who Takamichi's affections might center on. I think that this might be due to this being such a dramatic switch to drama after being so heavily comedic for the previous two volumes. There are several cute scenes in this volume, but the focus here is more on drama at times. It's not the die-hard drama-drama, but it's enough to where it just doesn't feel balanced at times. \\n Now aside from that, I am still interested in the series to where I'll probably continue to read it as the books are released. I just really hope that at some point the series finds a happy balance between manic cute comedy and somber drama. This just feels like it could be more than what it is, but it just hasn't reached that point yet.\", 'this \\n is \\n my \\n last \\n journey.', \"My least favorite so far, but that's not saying so much considering how much I love the series as a whole\", \"To deutero teukhos antapokrinetai sta epeisodia 5 kai 6 tou anime kai stis nukhtes 6 eos 9.

Many of the characters that are supposed to be of the same species don't look much alike, and yet the majority of creatures who are supposed to be different look surprisingly similar.

A partir de ahora no se que tanto la veremos en Tsubasa, al menos espero que un poco mas, puesto que la relacion entre estos mangas es genial. \\n Al llegar al pais de Clow aparentemente las cosas son normales, la gente que vive ahi al parecer lleva una vida tranquila y se estan preparando para una celebracion; la cual mas adelante resultara una pista importante; aunque saben de antemano que hay algo diferente por las advertencias de Yuuko aun es demasiado pronto para tener idea de que pueda ser. \\n Debo decir que la relacion de Kurogane y Fye me encanta mucho, ambos han cambiado mucho y ahora es casi imposible que alguno de ellos no sea lo suficientemente observador o perspicaz para darse cuenta de algo. \\n Una vez transcurrido \"algo\" de tiempo ya es demasiado evidente lo que resulta diferente aunque la razon del porque de esta alteracion en el tiempo esta ocurriendo no es del todo clara y aunque sacan algunas conclusiones deciden observar un poco mas. \\n Confirmando que lo que habian observado en un principio resulta ser cierto en cuanto a lo que sucede en el pais de Clow, se dan cuenta de que el hecho de que ellos se encuentren ahi empieza a alterar la continuidad de las cosas y de la vida de los que viven ahi...con consecuencias inesperadas. Esta parte ha resultado desconcertante tanto para ellos como para mi, el hecho de que Fei Wong actue como si nada a lo que le empieza a ocurrir a los habitantes como si fuese lo mas natural lo convierte en un ser aun mas despreciable de lo que ya es. \\n Ante esto nuestros viajeros no pueden hacer nada si no continuar su viaje, y sabiendo cual era la celebracion que esperaban los habitantes, ya tienen un sitio al cual dirigirse para encontrar lo que estan buscando sin duda alguna. \\n Syaoran es un personaje que claramente carga un poco mas con el peso de todo lo que esta sucediendo y es un alivio que tanto Fye como Kurogane esten ahi para apoyarlo. Al final presiento que desempenaran un papel importante como lo han venido haciendo hasta ahora. \\n Es en este momento que al llegar a su proximo destino, nos vamos enterando de bastantes cosas sobre Syaoran que me han dejado sorprendida. \\n Toda esta explicacion me ha emocionado y me ha dejado con muchas preguntas y claro, finalmente con una posible respuesta a una ansiada pregunta en relacion con Holic, que aun espero que se termine de confirmar...sin duda todo es inusitado y fascinante al mismo tiempo, pero no dejo de tener esa sensacion de que todo esta algo enrevesado por el momento. \\n Yuuko desde un inicio tiene una participacion importante en esta historia y el conocer la historia de Syaoran desde antes de que se uniera al viaje resulta por demas interesante, llena de informacion sobre su relacion con Sakura y por lo visto mas adelante en esta explicacion nos enteraremos del porque se ha originado todo este viaje y de que manera se relaciona con los eventos y personas involucradas tanto de ahora como del pasado. \\n Tengo mucha curiosidad de saber que otras sorpresas habran en esta historia y espero que las respuestas a algunas preguntas que se han ido formulando lleguen pronto para terminar de entender todo lo que ha estado sucediendo en este viaje. \\n Sin duda sigo disfrutando enormemente de esta historia y la recomiendo mucho.', \"** spoiler alert ** \\n Can't go wrong with pacing when essentially each of the 12 months is an issue.

Though that carnage is outrageous and sad beyond belief, sometimes you want people to realize that it is the hourly small inconveniences and humiliations that get to you the most, and that wear you down. \\n Look out your window to whatever is across the street--neighbor, office, store? What do you do if you want to visit that neighbor or shop at that store? You walk outside and cross the street. You may be required to walk a few feet to a crossing, but traveling time isn\\'t really something you consider. \\n Now imagine that one day construction equipment shows up, backed up by soldiers with automatic weapons, a wall goes up in the middle of your street that makes it impossible to simply walk across. There will be breaks in the wall, but at those breaks are installed TSA checkpoints, except the TSA people have guns, and permission to shoot to kill. Suddenly it takes hours and dozens of miles just to cross that street. Imagine that, instead of the front, this wall is constructed without your permission in the big, fat middle of your backyard garden and your vegetables that you slaved over all spring now belong to whoever is on the other side of the wall! \\n Everyone is familiar with the West bank barrier, or \"The Wall\" that Israel has constructed for what they term \"security,\" and others say for the genocide of Palestinians. This isn\\'t to be debated by me as I can say nothing that has not already been said, and nothing that will change what is going on. This isn\\'t even about my stance on the issue. Why? Because Jerusalem Chronicles from the Holy City by Guy Delisle, and translated by Helge Dasher, is not a recapitulation of the opinions regarding the wall, nor does it address any possible solution. It is a daily diary of the small things that make a huge difference. \\n The wall, in its totality, is approximately 440 miles [708 kilometers] in length if placed together end to end; it is in some places fence and others 20 foot-26 foot [6-8 meters] concrete barriers; there are also 98 foot-328 foot [30-100 meters] \"buffer zones\" outside, sometimes with razor wire, cameras, trenches, and always the ever-present Israeli military at checkpoints, and around the perimeter. Palestinians are required to have registration papers in order to pass as well. \\n There are towns divided and sometimes miles to travel just to get across the street. \\n The places Palestinians are not allowed to go; the sometimes humiliating processes they must endure simply to get to work or to buy food for their families, and the daily inconveniences of the lack of things we take for granted, like uninterrupted electricity and water are inconceivable to us. All the while there are other people in their midst whom Palestinians believe have seized their land illegally, who not only get the basics, but who harass and intimidate them and their children, and consider them less than human. These are the small things that, at first interrupt your life, and then little by little, begin to make it intolerable. \\n Sometimes a stranger witnessing and acknowledging the small things makes a difference...', \"The last couple issues seem to be the result of some event I didn't read, so it was a little confusing at first.

Now for those people familiar with this superhero duo may find this outing a bit too comical compare to the gritty street feel of the previous Heroes for Hire books. But thanks to some witty dialogue the book still gives off a urban vibe. David Walker has elected for the first issues of this series to tell a rather simple story. Basically Luke Cage aka Power Man & Iron fist are duped by a close friend to get back an important family item from longtime Marvel Comics crime lord, Tombstone. Luke Cage is of course reluctant to team up with his former partner crime fighter but soon events begin to spiral out of control and word soon spreads around the city that Power Man & Iron Fist are back to bust up crime. The book is filled with some humorous moments. I really enjoyed the fun and the dialogue between Iron Fist and Cage. The scenes with Jessica Jones were hilarious as well.

While Glitter Kiss is a bit silly and light-hearted, it contained a good lesson for both genders. \\n I would've like to the images in color, though the lack of it might have been because I had an ARC.

That being said, I think there's definitely room for improvement in future volumes. \\n First off, this is a manga about marriage - couldn't you tell? Asuka is 24, works in an office, and is extremely successful - but she wants to get married and be a homemaker eventually. Amongst her peers and various others, this seems like a weird notion - Asuka is good at her job, seems so independent, and besides that, being a homemaker isn't exactly in vogue anymore; most women of her generation want to keep their jobs and their hobbies going despite marriage. Thankfully, the story does expand on her reasoning for wanting to settle down, and it comes across pretty genuine and heartfelt - it may seem like a small dream to others, but it is truly her dream. \\n Soon Asuka meets Nanami - a charming young newscaster whom she somewhat accidentally ends up in love with. The only problem? He despises the idea of marriage - even though he has fallen in love with her, as well. And herein lies the setup and the tone of the story - clashing ideals on what marriage is, should be, whether or not it's truly a necessity when in love with someone (and vice versa), and what it means to be true to yourself, all come into play. \\n What I liked about the story was that each character seemed to make sense and have real motivations and feelings - as I said, Asuka's fantasy of being a homemaker doesn't come across as submissive or naive, so as to be a stereotype; similarly, Nanami's hatred of marriage, though a bit misguided, makes sense to me emotionally. He may be a bit of a jerk (in my opinion), but he's not just a bad apple. \\n But despite my enjoyment of the story, I couldn't help but feel like this volume was a bit sparse. Although it deals with some pretty heavy topics, it doesn't quite go into the most detail on things, which results in this being a pretty soft read. A boon to some, perhaps, but I personally wanted more in-depth drama. \\n I feel like this could be helped with a larger, more fleshed out supporting cast. The story seems to have quite a few characters in it, but there's really only our female lead, our male lead, and very, very rarely, one supporting male and female each that get any time on the page. This is a detriment to the story - in a story where we're offered conflicting views on relationships, love, and marriage, we're really only shown ideas about such topics through the prism of our leads - the two supports kind of chip in their opinions as well, but they're overly simplified since this isn't their story, I suppose. \\n I want to stress that the volume didn't feel overly shallow here, though - it did have enough depth to satisfy me. I just think that it really could have, and should have, had a bit more depth. Perhaps in future volumes... \\n Visually, the art here is solid, though I did take issue with a few things. For one, the artist seems very fond of using 2 entire pages just to convey one or two sentences, often with closeups, swirling light patterns, and large font. This isn't a problem in itself - when a big, important line or idea is stated, it can be an effective technique to convey impact. But like many things, moderation is key; unfortunately, I found that this manga used the technique far too often, to the point of annoyance. Again, this is something that makes the manga feel sparse, since there are sometimes these wide open pages of...really not much going on. \\n All in all, I think the manga has a few issues, but it's mostly a good read if the idea and concept interests you; otherwise, I would say most definitely give this one a pass, as there's nothing else here to hook you aside from the discussion of marriage - the characters themselves are good for this purpose, but not strong enough on their own that I would recommend reading the volume even if you have no interest, unfortunately. \\n 3 out of 5 stars.\", '** spoiler alert ** \\n On Your Own, the second volume of Buffy Season 9, picks right up where Freefall left off as Buffy tries to deal with the news that she is pregnant (and that this came about without her knowing how, suggesting she may well have been raped). As melodramatic as an unexpected pregnancy might sound, I thought it was an intriguing premise: How does a Slayer balance being a parent? A cameo from a returning character provides some partial answers to this, and it\\'s nice seeing Buffy again turn to Spike for assistance. \\n But then ... Wow. The twist. \\n I suspect this will polarise the fans, but for me, it didn\\'t work, not in the slightest. In fact, I almost threw away Season 9 right then and there. My loyalty to the show, however, wouldn\\'t permit it. \"See it through\", I told myself. \"It has to get better.\" \\n Here\\'s hoping, because so far Season 9 is just as disappointing as Season 8 - and it doesn\\'t even have the good grace to hide that its disappointing, like Season 8 did, by being enjoyable to start with and then massively falling away. \\n And seriously: What is up with the tame people-sized cockroaches?

His first story tells the classic Chinese myth of a monkey king who studies martial arts until he is nearly god-like, only to find that true happiness comes from accepting who he really is and using his talents to help others. The second story is of a seemingly-average American teenage boy trying to deal with the usual--sports, schools, girlfriend--not to mention his overbearingly Chinese cousin who ruins his social life with an annual visit. The last story is about a Chinese American boy trying to fit in at his school. How the three tales come together will surprise and delight the reader. \\n Reactions: American Born Chinese is an excellent book for looking at racial stereotypes. It treats its characters with a roundness that is sometimes lacking in more didactic titles. The one obvious exception to this is the Chinese cousin, who pushes his role as intended stereotype so far that it may frustrate the reviewer into almost quitting (like this one), even when the reviewer knows this is the entire point. The astute reader may anticipate how the three stories ultimately fit together, but many will be surprised. All will be delighted at the end, which mixes solid resolution with the comfortable feeling that there is more to be done, just not at this moment.', \"I thought this was a fun graphic novel with a great story.

A new comics publisher is almost always a good thing, but judging by this book, it's not always a blessing. \\n I grew up reading Mort Walker's comics, and for a time I thought them the best there was. Needless to say, as an adult I don't feel the same about these comics anymore, but it is still fun to see them getting the book treatment like this. \\n And there are thing to recommend here. This is a collection of modern day Hi & Lois strips, but the book is also full of earlier strips (Hi & Lois was started already in 1954), special strips and Sunday pages made at various anniversaries for the strip, and an interesting series of strips from 1994, when the character Beetle Bailey (who's supposed to be Lois' brother) visit the family. Some of these I had not seen before and they are certainly interesting historically. \\n The problem is the moderna day strips, made by the sons of the two original creators. They are bland, uninteresting and reactionary, not to say sexist. They all leave me cold, making me wish that the strip had been laid down to rest when Mort Walker and Dik Browne left it. \\n Then there the production of the book, which seems to have been done rather quickly. There are strips printed with too low resolution, translation errors, anglicism, typographical errors and so on. It all gives me a feeling that no-one really bothered with the quality of this book, at all. \\n The shoddy production really has me clamouring for the books produced by Affe Thorsjo in my youth. He really loved what he was doing and put so much pride into making each and every book perfect, even though the material he had to work with, i.e. Beetle Bailey, Hi & Lois, Hagar the Horrible and so on, weren't always that interesting. \\n Oh well, this book still gets two stars, for the historically interesting material it presents, but I hope Affe Thorsjo never sees this ...\", 'September 20107 - Ben was drawn to the graphic novels shelves at the library recently, and I love the Toon books so I pushed him in that direction (short enough for a read-aloud). He was totally fascinated with the cartoon panels and really worked to decipher what was happening on each page. Minimal text makes it great for pre-readers or early readers to look at independently.', \"'Tabatha' by Neil Gibson, with art by Caspar Wijngaard is another trippy, super dark journey that fits well with Gibson's other work. There is plenty of humor, which at times feels strange in such a dark tale. \\n Luke works as a mailman in Los Angeles. This gives him plenty of time to figure out which houses are empty so he and his friends can go back and burglarize them. When they find the house of a Hollywood special effects man, things spiral in a strange direction. They discover real body parts, and a lifesized doll, known by the owner as Tabatha. He is using his guile and craft to try to bring her to life, and Luke and his friends have stumbled into his dark life. Ignoring the rules of horror films, Luke and his friends find themselves caught in a horror show with a crafty killer who will stop at nothing to bring his creation to life. \\n The cover is bright and doesn't depict the darkness in the story, but if you are familiar with TPub and the Twisted Dark series, you know the kind of thing you are in for. It's hard to feel sympathetic for Luke, his friends, or the deranged killer who views the world through his rose-tinted glasses. The humor is the book is odd and oddly placed. Luke is in peril and chooses to sarcastically taunt his captor, who is wielding an axe, so the consequences seem predetermined. The book also pokes fun at the strange types that live in L.A. I did like it though. \\n I received a review copy of this graphic novel from Diamond Book Distributors, TPub, and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you for allowing me to review this graphic novel.\", \"A whole lot of different layers of storytelling are going on again, here. Sometimes this feels like a slightly more grounded version of the Mignolaverse at its best; at other times it still bears comparison to the X-Files if Mulder and Scully themselves were subjects of X-Files.

Lucas and his followers kill all the adults, which means the parents...when some people don't believe in this philosophy and are heartbroken by their loss. It was interesting seeing the tension between Lucas's followers and the rebels. There's a lot of bloodshed, gore, and language in this book, so it's not for the faint of heart.

Yeah right? I grew up watching anime and when I stumbled to this one, I instantly got hook. I\\'m so in love with this anime that I have the complete anime series in my possession. Yep! It occupy mostly the memory of my external drive haha sucker I know. And it\\'s just now that I finally had the courage to read its manga. I started reading this last December but had a 1 week off because of the Holiday until finally I finished it! \\n This story is about this modern Japanese girl, Kagome, that was pulled from her own time and went to feudal Japan. It is where she met the half yokai (supernatural monster in Japanese folklore) or also called Hanyou, Inuyasha. Two opposite personalities that were forced to travel together because of the Shikon Jewel or the Jewel of Four Souls. \\n Kagome (female lead) is so much fun and a wonderful heroine. If she\\'s a real person, she could be my hero. And Inuyasha on the other hand is such an awesome badass that thinking about him hurts. And as a couple, they sure are mind blowing. After writing this review, I\\'ll definitely re-watch the anime hehe. \\n Speaking of which, Inuyasha is a bad boy. But he\\'s the awesome kind of bad boy with humor and with a touch of dumbness at the same time. When he first met Kagome, I swear he could really be a great pain in the ass and is a straight-up a-hole. And as the story progresses, he became this kind of awesome person without losing his bad boy image ofcourse. And when it comes to Kagome, he sure is kind of protective and I love their usual bantering. It could get annoying sometimes but mostly entertaining lol, especially when Kagome really gets angry at him. \\n His character is so realistic too. Behind the bad boy image is the guy who lost his first love and when she returned, he\\'s torn between her and Kagome. Which to be honest, made me kind of mad at him. Well, I\\'m 100% with Kagome and I totally hate Kikyou. But after reading the manga, I still don\\'t like her, but she is kind of likeable now especially when she saved Kohaku. And also Inuyasha\\'s inner battle with his demon blood and his human heart, and you know what\\'s awesome about it? It\\'s because it\\'s only Kagome who can make him back to his senses, isn\\'t that just sweet? \\n (I was a bit teary-eyed when the Spider youkai were after them and he got bitten while he\\'s in his human form. And speaking of human form, he sure still rock it even with black hair minus the cute doggy ears. Then he lay on Kagome\\'s lap and told her that he love her scent even if he told her otherwise before. They\\'re in the middle of a dangerous situation but because of that, it became kind of romantic and unforgettable scene for me.) \\n Kagome on the other hand is a typical female lead. She started as a helpless girl until they found out about her being the reincarnation of Kikyou which was Inuyasha\\'s first love and the strongest Miko in the feudal Japan. I love how she became badass as the story progresses. Kikyou may be the first woman Inuyasha loved, but it is Kagome who really changed Inuyasha as a person. Plus, did I tell you how many times she saved Kikyou? Also, even how many times she got hurt because she\\'s Inuyasha\\'s first love, her heart remains pure. \\n I have to be honest, there\\'s some point in this series that totally got my nerve and made me flipped. That\\'s mostly about Inuyasha being torn between Kikyou and Kagome and how many times he chose Kikyou over Kagome. I mean, that\\' quite of cruel really. But even that\\'s the case, I learn to outgrow it simply because he still travels with her, plus, once in a while they have their own moments. And speaking of moment, I need to step ahead and point out the lack of kissing scenes between them. In anime there\\'s quite a lot, but in manga, almost none. Yeah right? \\n As they travel, their group of two grows into a group of 6 where they met the kitsune Shippou, the monk Miroku, cool Sango and her cute Kirara. \\n Shippou is a cute Kitsune (fox) yokai that specializes in making pranks which he mostly use to Inuyasha lol. At first, they both hate each other and argues which is kind of funny lol. But as they both travels together, their relationship improved. He is really adorable and so attached to Kagome. \\n Miroku - A playboy and pervert who loves caressing women\\'s butt. But his proposal to Sango was pretty sweet. \\n Sango - a really tough cookie. I love her character and the fact that she can man handle guys. And her relationship with Miroku was so kawaii. \\n (Quite cliche eh? Inuyasha and Kagome fell in love with each other and Miroku, Sango with each other too. Well, IDC haha. I just love their group.) \\n Kirara - is a cute yokai that transforms into a ferocious beast during battles. Plus, he flies! \\n With a very long series, a long list of character isn\\'t a surprise at all. But what\\'s really hard with manga or anime is to get familiarize with the character\\'s names. But as for my favorites or the ones that totally got my attention here\\'s my list. (I\\'m being mean today, so I\\'m not going to add Kikyou in my list, blee) \\n 1. Number one in my list is Sesshoumaru. I never thought I\\'d say this, but I\\'m one of those really annoying fangirls who love him. Deym! When I first saw him in the anime, I\\'ve got to say that there\\'s something dangerous about him. Inuyasha has this bad boy image, but Sesshoumaru is on the highest level. I really hate him at first. Unlike Inuyasha, he really is living the bad boy life. He\\'s rude, full of pride and all things bad. I specifically hated how he keeps on stealing their Father\\'s memento, Tessaiga, that is originally given to I But everything changed when he met Rin, and then we got to find out about Tenseiga and everything about it. Then, it just happens, I love Sesshoumaru. And then I came to the part about Meidou Zangetsuha, I feel so sorry for him. Huhu, and then after that my admiration for him intensified. He made me feel so many emotions, I almost cried because of him. It will take too much writing if I\\'ll enumerate the things that made me love Sesshoumaru so I\\'ll just let these images speaks for itself. \\n 2. Well, obviously, it\\'s Rin. I love her character simply because she\\'s the reason why Sesshoumaru became compassionate, which is also the reason how he was now able to use his healing sword T And I love her teasing with Jaken. I love how the boring team of two grows and became lively because of her.Honestly, at first, I\\'m one of those fans that ships Rin to Sesshoumaru. But after I read the manga, I realized how absurd that is. I don\\'t know, but I think Jaken is right. Sesshoumaru is like a father to Rin in a strange way, and he sure is a great one. \\n 3. Kagome\\'s family, her mother, younger brother Shouta, grandpa including their cat Buyo. I thought it\\'s going to be a big shocker when they met Inuyasha, but end up petting him like a pet dog lol. They\\'re all touching Inuyasha\\'s ears haha. Well, that couldn\\'t be help lol especially if he has that adorable doggy ears. \\n 4. Kouga - The moment he was introduced in this series, I can\\'t stop laughing. He\\'s the third party between Inuyasha and Kagome and I can\\'t really stop laughing whenever I remember the scene where he boldly said that he loves Kagome and he\\'s determine to make her his woman. Well, after what Kagome went through because of Kikyou, I can\\'t help but send Inuyasha a dirty sign. Blee! \\n 5. Miyouga - The coward flea. He\\'s some sort of the guy who knows it all, well, not totally all but mostly about Inuyasha and his father. I wish this series was able to show something about the past especially about Inuyasha\\'s father and mother. Well, it did actually in the anime. \\n 6. Totosai - The swordsmith who forged Tessaiga and Tenseiga due to Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru\\'s father\\'s request. I would have love it more if they included a back story of him too. \\n 7. Kaede - Kikyou\\'s younger sister. A strong lady who would probably live another 50 years the way she\\'s going. \\n 8. Kohaku - The younger brother of Sango. For a young age, he\\'s been through a lot. But I\\'m happy how he was able to regain or fight for his humanity after what Naraku did to him. \\n 9. Jaken - Originally, I didn\\'t have the intention of adding him in this list but looking back, I have to say that he made my whole reading experience so enjoyable too. He\\'s Sesshoumaru\\'s companion. He\\'s arrogant and even pitiful sometimes especially when he receives death glare or punches from Sesshoumaru when he\\'s pissed but he is mostly funny especially when Rin joined the group. \\n 10. Naraku - For the ultimate cunning supervilain, I guess he quite deserve to be in this list lol. He\\'s a hanyou like Inuyasha. He\\'s the reason why Kikyou died 50 years ago and is the reason why Kikyou and Inuyasha had a rough past. \\n When I think about it, this is obviously a typical adventure anime/manga. For an adventure stories, the idea of different set of individuals forming a group while traveling is quite cliche too, let alone falling in love with each other! But what sets this story different from others is on the adventures each characters went through. When I though it\\'s the end and the ideas are already sucked out dry from the author, we then introduced to a new unexpected scene. I\\'ve been watching anime and they all gave me the same reaction. And what is that? It\\'s astonishment. We might already encountered the story\\'s plot before, but the twists and turns, the scenes, the lines are so unique. I can\\'t count how many times I said out loud \"I didn\\'t expected that!\" while reading this series. \\n All we\\'re covered too. I love that each characters has their own background covered, so we all got the chance to really know more about them and where they come from. I love that each characters have the chance to stand out and we\\'ve got to see how they matured with each chapters. As the title goes, without watching the anime, I really thought this series would only revolves around Inuyasha, well, it kind of does since each characters have a connection with Inuyasha. But what I like to say is that the author didn\\'t made a selfish decision to just make Inuyasha the hero all the time. We\\'ve got the chance to see the weaker side of him, the annoying one, the part where others from the group became the hero and saved him, and ofcourse the funny and dense Inuyasha which is my favorite. \\n As I said, this series has a total of 559 chapters so it will absolutely take us a lot of time if I talk about the adventures the group encountered one by one. So to make it short, I\\'ll just \"kind of share\" my favorite chapters from this series. Before I decided to read this manga, I have a lot of favorite scenes from the anime, mostly? Well, all of them we\\'re from Kagome and Inuyasha. But after reading the manga, I have to say that my favorite scenes were from Sesshoumaru (Inuyasha\\'s youkai brother). The first one was when he met Rin (human girl) and resurrected her. I really love how little by little he changed from this full mean badboy image to a compassionate one. He\\'s still a badboy but when he\\'s with Rin, dayum, I just can\\'t help but squeal in delight. And another favorite scene was when he went inside the meidou (a place where the living are not suppose to go) to save Rin. It\\'s also the most touching scene ever because of how he discarded his sword tenseiga (his father\\'s memento) because it can\\'t save Rin. Like dang! (just zoom the image to read the lines) \\n For my rating, I\\'m detracting a half star. It really is painful but I guess I really need to. It\\'s because even with the 559 chapters, it failed to tell us an introduction of what really is a yokai or hanyou or everything about those so-called monster. I mean, it\\'s been 50 years after that the story resumed but Sesshoumaru look as fabulous as ever and so is Inuyasha. I mean, if Inuyasha and Kagome will live together as man and wife, Kagome will age and Inuyasha would still be looking the same? The slowness of the villains too is quite so-so but I understand that to make this series long. Also, about crossing time through the well, in its first few chapters, we\\'ve got to find out that it\\'s the Shikon Jewel that connects the two worlds, but I remembered after Naraku seized all the shards of the Jewel, Kagome was still able to go back to her world. That really is kinda confusing though. And lastly, the epilogue. Dang! Sango and Miroku had their three little angels, how come Inuyasha and Kagome didn\\'t have atleast 1 son or daughter?! Oh well, I guess you can\\'t really have all. \\n You might be wondering which one of the two I love, manga or anime, I have to say that I love both. All the scenes from manga can be seen in anime, but what\\'s great with anime is that there\\'s some new scenes added to it. So if you\\'re planning to read the manga, I would highly recommend watching the anime too. \\n I would highly recommend this series, if you\\'re down for a good solid adventure and a kickass heroine with a sexy demon badboy. It\\'s often hilariously funny and the drawing is so lovely. It\\'s just simply awesome. \\n Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars \\n Read my full review post \\n To read more of my reviews, book news and updates: \\n Main Blog: Blushing Geek \\n Facebook Page \\n Subscribe to mailing list', \"In this volume of The Unwritten, the War of Words arc is interspersed with side stories that highlight the power of words and storytelling - particularly those involving Wilson Taylor and Pullman, but also from the perspective of new characters.

This is a trade paperback issue. \\n \"Intriguing redesign that stays faithful to the old Larry Hama-era version at times, Cobra Command is a must read for any fan of the setting and the characters. This is G.I.Joe for the modern age.\" ~The Founding Fields \\n I\\'ve been into G.I.Joe ever since as a kid. My earliest memory is of one of my birthdays when my parents got me a 4-box set of the Cobra Night Landing Speedboat, the Joe Weapon Transport rig, the Joe Bomb Disposal unit and a Joe Devilfish. In those days, everything G.I.Joe was sold by Funskool in India, be it the action figures themselves or the various tanks and aircraft. Those were good days. I remember that keeping all the weapons and gear was one of my biggest issues because I\\'d kept losing them. Even at college, I took a few with me for nostalgia\\'s sake. They happened to be Flint, Lady Jaye, Storm Shadow and Freefall (I think it is Freefall, not sure). College was also when I really dived into the old Marvel comics, written by Larry Hama, and some of the other spinoff/sequel comics to that 155-issue run. As I\\'d seen the animated series before reading the comics, the latter made that whole experience complete for me. \\n Reacquainting with the G.I.Joe franchise with G.I.Joe The Movie was a rude experience because the Hama-purist in me found everything to be wrong with it. Everything was like some kind of perversion of my most fun memories of the franchise. The most significant of these issues were that changes made to the relationship between Scarlett/Snake Eyes, with Flint and the Baroness being an item. \\n Coming back to these characters last month with IDW\\'s Cobra Command Volume 1, written by Chuck Dixon, was a pure treat in comparison. While the world has significantly moved on since the Larry Hama days, or the various canonical/non-canonical versions that have followed, these guys are still all part of the team. They still navigate the convoluted politics being played by the Washington top brass while Cobra does what it does best: terror and mayhem in countries that lack allies in the wider world. \\n I haven\\'t read any of the other IDW reboots as yet, but I have to say that I\\'m really impressed with Dixon\\'s work with Cobra Command. This series is a sequel to the Cobra Civil War arc, one which I\\'m rather keen on reading as soon as I can. While it has been several years since I\\'ve read the original Marvel run or the Devil\\'s Due sequels (the latter of which I\\'m rather fond of as well), Dixon\\'s script, Alex Cal\\'s art, J. Brown\\'s colours and Dave Wilkins\\' cover really take me back to those days. Cobra Command is just as exciting as any of those oldies and I think it really brings that modern-day feel to the franchise, albeit without the ridiculousness of the movie. \\n The story of Cobra Command follows on from the Civil War arc as I mentioned, and now the Cobra Commander has begun to make his presence felt while the Joes are still recovering from their recent losses and having to make do with a reduced asset profile. That leads to a lot of tension between the team members, as well as no small amount of frustration as they aren\\'t able to counter the Cobra threat effectively. \\n Yet, they do what they have always done best. The Joes deploy in small four-man infiltration teams within enemy territory, wreaking havoc wherever and whenever in order to give the international community the time to respond. And while they are walking around the jungles and the plains, the new Cobra Commander continues to roll out one surprise or another. \\n You can find the full review over at The Founding Fields: \\n http://thefoundingfields.com/2012/07/...', \"My new favorite book that offers hilarious insights into the author's soul, and, of course, if one wasn't herself mightily repressing a similar journey, a look into one's own psyche as well.

His role as janitor in Fabletown (and his tendency to eat flies) is a way of escaping and dealing (or not dealing with his sorrow). but the time has come for him to face his past head on.

It has some great detail in there - I like that Byrne's smoothing through gaps in canon, with this comic touching on the Organian-imposed truce between the Klingons and the Federation, something that the tv series imposed and then forgot about, for example. It also has the first encounter between Kirk and Koloth, and some welcome dashes of humour. Unfortunately, where this one doesn't work for me is the relationship between Kirk and his brother; it might be better if I didn't remember both Kirk's brother from the tv show, and the episode in which William Shatner's brother appeared, but I couldn't buy into the relationship between Kirk and his brother in this comic. From the text, there's an interesting story about siblings and trust wrapped up in a Klingon spy plot, but the photos just don't work for me in bringing it across.\", \"This is a beautiful book, a beautiful piece of folklore, beautifully illustrated. It is not told in the usual Sandman comic style, but in a longer prose format, and the illustrations and prose complement each other perfectly. It can work as a standalone story, but is richer if you are already familiar with the Sandman universe. It's a haunting story with what is probably the most gorgeous artwork in the entire series. I loved it.\", \"My favorite Buffyverse comic bar none. This is everything I want a Spike comic to be. Complex characters with great chemistry, lots of action, and incredible artwork. \\n SPOILERS INCOMING \\n Spike shines as a leader (aka a champion), while still being wise enough to accept help and advice from his friends. On the outside, he's as witty and bold as ever, but we also get to see a more sensitive side of Spike, especially when he expresses his feelings for Buffy, greets Willow, and loses his soul. Personally, I was thrilled to see Spike retain his goodness without his soul, as that is what makes him the hero of the series (over Angel) to me. \\n The supporting characters are equally complex and endearing. Beck remains strong and powerful, and I appreciate that she can accept that Spike does not reciprocate her love. Betta George remains his practical and caring self, and I love him for it. The scenes with Willow, especially with her and Spike, are especially touching, and I adored seeing their relationship develop further. As for Druscilla, I like the way Lynch handled her character and how her presence showed how far Spike has come. \\n While I believe Urru also did the art for the other Spike comics I've read, he is truly on his A-game for this one. The scenes are stunning and clear, and the characters faces and expressions fit perfectly with the actors (when appropriate). I could see this entire book playing like a movie in my mind. The coloring, too, was exceptionally beautiful. \\n The plot is full of action, with Wolfram and Hart as the big bads again, supported by a soulless human serial killer named John. There were a few twists I did not see coming - Spike losing (then regaining) his soul and the arrival of the aliens. My only complaint with the plot (and the entire book) is that it ended on a cliffhanger. Will Spike and his bugs find and defeat Wolfram and Hart? Since this seems to be all of the series, I guess I just have to hope it is answered when Spike eventually reappears in the Buffy comics.\", 'Demasiada accion y muy poca historia', \"Now I've read all the Lunch Lady books.

(They even have a Hawkeye Marvel Select figure which features pizza dog which is all kinds of awesome - makes me wish I was still inclined to buy action figures.) \\n Should also note that this title also features the other Hawkeye Kate Bishop in a sort of sidekick support role (which makes for some great dialogue.)

It goes with the original, early '90s take on the character, mixed with a bit of the fourth-wall-breaking that came a little later. But because it's a classic version of the character, it does mean the humour is very strong. X-Force doesn't really get to do much, aside from Cable, who's also in his early-'90s form, and also pretty fun. The art has a bit of a '90s feel, but done well. It gets the feel, without really following the worst excesses of the decade, so it's actually pretty good to look at. \\n This is something that's an easy recommendation for Deadpool fans, even long-time fans.\", \"Enjoyed the story, excited to see what's in store for this family.\", 'I saw the movie when I was in High School and thought it was like the most bad ass movie of all time.

I was probably mean as a High School kid, too, and I\\'m not stupid--I get that a lot of Enid\\'s cruelty comes from her anger of things happening in her past and feeling insecure but. Seriously??? They are two of the most angry and cruel girls.

But Nanaue is not just human- he has a giant snapping jaw coming out of his back. He steals fish from the villages, who chase him to the bottom of the ocean, where he reunites with his lost father. \\n It would have been one thing if he had had a fin on his back- but a giant snapping jaw? It's creepy! Nanaue isn't terribly sympathetic, either- he lies to his mother about the fish he catches, he steals from the village even as they starve, and brags. The story is a little choppy- going from past to present to future present very quickly. It's a short book and the story seems rushed- also a little confusing for children. \\n This is not my favorite graphic novel for young people. This is supposed to be for grades 2-3, but I'm not buying it. Story-wise, this story should be told for older students. But pacing and vocabulary wise? This is too simple. \\n Interesting concept, but poorly executed.\", 'Yeah, this is amazing. I actually read this about a month ago, but forgot to rate it apparently?

It\\'s so much fun to try and recognise what film is being referenced in each comic panel, and it was fun to learn about so many other films that have been influential to the medium. It\\'s a great intro to film theory, with the graphic novel divided into chapters about various features of cinema from \"Sets and Architecture\" to \"Power and Ideology\". \\n I enjoyed the simple black and white art style, though more often than not a lot of information and film references were squeezed into each panel, and how Edward Ross was a character in it, he was like the narrator, leading the reader through the history of film and what we see on screen means. \\n Filmish is a great insight into film theory. It introduces the reader to so many films and ideas but in a really accessible way which makes this informative read, an enjoyable one.', 'The story itself, actually, two stories dealing with mysteries in Gotham, were great. Jonah Hex and Amadeus Arkham as kind of a weird version of Watson and Holmes solving mysteries in Old Gotham was delightful. The art was fantastic too.

Not to mention I just didn't want all the exciting adventure to end. This new comic book series, though late in getting out into the world, picks up where the TV series left off, after Aang has defeated the evil Fire Lord Ozai, and has restored peace and balance to the world. Well, he sort of has... \\n In this first serialized comic book installment, Zuko is now the new Fire Lord, and he and Aang, now acting as the world's ambassador Avatar, decide that all the Fire Nation colonies located within the Earth Kingdom need to be displaced back to the Fire Nation homeland. They believe there can be no real peace if those colonies remain where they are because they were built as a result of the Fire Nation's occupancy of the Earth Kingdom. Earth Kingdom peoples are wanting them gone. \\n But, Zuko finds some of the Fire Nation colonists are resistant to this displacement. The Fire Nation people of this colony have been living there for over one hundred years, and feel that Fire Lord Zuko is a traitor to them for making them leave their prosperous home. Someone makes an attempt on his life, and he winds up spending some time there with the colonists and realizes he has to go back on his word to support the Earth King in removing the people. This makes all his trusted friends, Aang, Katara, and Sokka believe he's becoming like his father, who is still in a Fire Nation prison. \\n Mostly what fuels the plot is a big misunderstanding between Zuko and Aang, and this time Zuko is in the right. Aang doesn't even realize just how hard this displacement will be on the citizens of the colonies, so they try to talk things out, as world leaders ought to. They are only able to get the Earth Kingdom protestors who want the colonists to leave to stop protesting, but that's about it. It ends with Zuko doing something quite shocking in regards to his imprisoned father, evidence that Zuko is continually haunted by him and his wicked legacy. \\n Zuko is the ultimate bad boy trying to change, but is constantly backsliding again and again. Despite the fact that he fought on the side of the Avatar during the war, and helped to defeat his sister, Azula, along with his father, he still has a lot of darkness within him. He's still a teenager who has a lot to learn about running an entire country. So, too, does the Avatar gang have a lot to learn about maintaining the world in a peaceful, balanced way. They are learning it's not as easy as it seems. Heck, even grown-ups can't get it right! \\n This new installment to the canon story felt like watching an episode of the cartoon series, in how it looked and felt on the story, dialogue, and characterization levels. The creators of the series are part of creating this comic book, so it ought to feel that way. The artwork is spectacular, as all the characters look just as they do in the cartoon. And, it leaves you with quite the shocking cliffhanger at the end! Somehow, this series is supposed to link up to the new Avatar Korra cartoon that will debut on Nickelodeon later this year, but exactly how is still not clear. I can't wait to read the next installment. \\n *I received this from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\", \"ishwy@ posts mn `l~ l facebook wmHTwTyn fy ktb \\n bs ktb dmh khfyf, 'n DHkt, wdh kfy@ l dlwqty.\", \"I'm finding Grant Morrison's Batman to be a bit more obtuse than his other superhero work, but it's still good, despite being often indecipherable. \\n This book is bisected in two stories. The first story introduces but doesn't explain the villainous Black Glove as the evil force behind a superhero murder mystery featuring Batman and a team of multicultural near-Batman (including creations like Wingman, The Knight, Dark Ranger, and Man-of-Bats and Little Raven). It's a good caper, and J.H. Williams III's art is usually great, but the storytelling last few pages falls apart. \\n The second story is also mostly great but with short bursts of nonsense. Batman goes through flashbacks and hallucinations as the fallout to an old Gotham police-sponsored experiment he went through years ago. And he has a new girlfriend.

It is probably because my mom is hard of hearing, so I can relate and am totally biased to the content within this book. However, I think this book does a great job at explaining how to talk and interact with hard of hearing and deaf individuals, and how they lead their lives. I think this is an important read for any hearing folks. It is also a fun read, and I loved that it was a graphic novel because the illustrations made it more exciting to read. I dont think it would have have the same feel if it was a graphic novel.', \"Questi episodi mi sono piaciuti molto poco: i due rapimenti compiuti da Gloria hanno un'impostazione da feuilleton che mi e sembrata un po' troppo banale.

Ah yes, the story itself... this volume opens up with Bunny's discovery of Darrien as Tuxedo Mask. Slowly the two start to get memories of their past lives together. It was a truly romantic plot at the front burner of this volume. We are also introduced to Sailor V who claims to be the Moon Princess the Scouts have sworn to protect. It isn't until the final chapter of this volume that the true Moon Princess is revealed as the Dark Kingdom injures and then abducts Tuxedo Mask. \\n Where I am still enjoying the series, I really feel it's colored with nostalgia. It's almost too quick-paced with plots only half developed as they progress. We still don't get a feel for the Scouts as individuals other than their solo chapters in the previous volume. Where it's a fun and lovely series, a non-seasoned Sailor Moon fan might not find it quite as engaging.\", \"This story arc started poorly, with two major faults in the plotting.

On paper (boom tish) Deadpool should tickle all of my reading spots: humour, irreverence, action, Ryan Reynolds man crush. But so far I'm still on the fence about being a fan. Admittedly I haven't read Joe Kelly's classic run, so maybe that is tainting my perspective. \\n So why read Deadpool Killustrated? Well, funny you should ask, voice in my head. I thought the premise and execution of Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe was an interesting story: a very meta tale. After you've read Punisher Kills The Marvel Universe, you'd think that the idea of one Marvel character finding a way to kill all the other Marvel characters is pretty much tapped out, but the Deadpool version took that idea so much further. Killustrated is the logical extension of that story, and hence worth a read. \\n I'm only giving this three stars, however, as the story felt somewhat abbreviated/abridged (much like Deadpool Kills). The story concept wasn't fully realised, but still worth a read.\", \"Bendis continues to rehabilitate himself in my eyes with this second volume. \\n I've never been shy of criticizing his work at marvel, but this story really rocks it.

It is not that kind of fiction - let\\'s be honest: scaring your audience is probably the hardest thing to do (just ask Mr. King). But I liked it. Like - I really liked it. Somehow. Maybe it is a guilty pleasure, or maybe it is that wonderfully freaky first chapter. Or the ending - that hopeless, somehow perfect for this story, ending. Or the fucking snails. \\n It is intriguing, it does manage to convince you to keep on reading. And not because there is nothing to watch on Netflix, but because it does grip you, despite the weirdness, despite the hilariously bad chapters (*spoiler - I guess* spiral hair. I repeat: SPIRAL SHAPED HAIR. Standing in the air. Like - wtf ever). What I am saying is: this is a flawed work, and requires a lot of suspension of disbelief. But it plays wonderfully with the fear of the unknown. It is a mad journey, the kind that just gets crazier and crazier. And the imagery is wonderful. Morbid and twisted, just my sick cup of tea. Junji Ito managed to surprise me: I enjoy his art-style maybe way too much. It is nothing THAT special (I mean, he is no Samura), but he is very competent and imaginative. \\n What else... the characters. I actually like both of them, and *mind blowing* I actually actually believed in their relationship .

I think it would've been better from an organizational standpoint to end this volume with Carrick's showdown with the guilty. The two chapters that follow are anti-climactic. \\n My only storyline nitpick is the presence of Sith magic items and their effects. It really pushes the Star Wars story from space opera over to space fantasy. That's just a personal preference. I accept the Force because that's been there from the beginning, but these Sith artifacts just take it too far. \\n An aspect I liked here about the Jedi was that they weren't always this monolithic monastic order. There were actually different factions, as this series illustrates, who took a healthier (IMO) approach to life. Unfortunately, the Jedi Council always seems to be easily fooled by the Sith and are too slow to realize that they've been duped. \\n The artwork is all over the place. I really like the styles of some guys, but definitely not others. There wasn't much consistency in the appearance of the major characters from one artist to another.

But it was nice to see the use of only pinks as it made you focus a lot more on what was illustrated, whilst also making it feel unique. I\\'m sure something like this has been done before but most graphic novels I\\'ve read are in full colour. \\n For the story itself the world building was lacking - its probably set on Earth or somewhere similar to it but with far advanced science and technology (mentions of a mine off world, closed off areas due to terraforming incomplete, and y\\'know the whole body transplant thing). But other than that nothing indicates that its society is far different from ours. \\n Though I also don\\'t see the lack of world building a bad thing given this graphic novel isn\\'t part of a series so for 80 pages in length I\\'m happy we got even a small glimpse whilst it focused on telling its story. \\n The character building was better, which is expected given this is a character focused story. There are 3 main characters all of whom are meeting after signing up for an experimental medical procedure where they will have a body transplant - their brain put into a new body, whilst their old is destroyed. \\n We\\'re shown flashbacks of them at the meeting where the procedure is explained and whilst this isn\\'t something that could be achieved currently you can tell the author has gone to great lengths to make it seem like it is possible in her science fiction world. \\n But the current timeline is of the three of them meeting afterwards in a coffee shop to talk things through with each other, to make sure they\\'re all happy with their decision to go through with it. here is an old lady, a writer, and older man, an ex-convict, and a young transmale who doesn\\'t want to me trapped in a female body any longer. \\n The story itself was mostly just focusing on these characters adjusting to the idea that they were going to have new bodies, new lives (if they survived the process). You don\\'t actually see the process or the things they have to go through in rehab to adjust to having a new body which\\'d probably made it sit even more at home in the science fiction section. \\n But we do get a tiny look at them after as they thank the others for helping them through it and looking for continued support in their lives. I liked this part as it just felt really nice to have characters that genuinely cared about one and another and knowing they\\'d have someone to turn too whilst they continued to adjust to life. \\n So as you can see from what I\\'ve written it had good aspects but also aspects missing in some areas so that is why it wont be a favourite read of mine but it was an interesting topic to tackle. \\n After the graphic novel there is a disertation of sorts explaining how this process isn\\'t something we could do today and goes in depth to discuss all the areas that would have to be considered and overcome should it ever be done. It was very scientific and I\\'m not that great with actual science so some of it was lost on me but it was a nice addition as it illustrated they had really thought it through. \\n It also left me concerned whether it could be viewed as problematic the way TFIOS is - a real problem with a fake cure/solution - so I wasn\\'t sure how to tackle this part of the reivew. At the end of the day I\\'m coming at this as someone who isn\\'t trans but didn\\'t want to be ignorant and not address the fact others may percieve it as harmful. \\n I\\'ve discussed it with a few people and they mostly felt that the inclusion of a trans person was a good thing because in a science fiction setting such as this it wouldn\\'t be unlikely they\\'d opt for the chance of a new body and it was good the story didn\\'t just focus on characters who wanted to look better for vanity sakes. \\n \"Part of worldbuilding in stories like that is considering how everyone will be affects. I think its very plausible that if this were something that was possible there would be trans people doing it.\" \\n However I am open to more discssion on this topic and at the end of the day will listen to how a trans person views it over anyone else. If my concerns were wrong/right please let me know and I can adapt the review as needed to inform others, but I couldn\\'t post a review without a heads up in case someone did pick it up and felt I\\'d portrayed the safety of the story incorrectly.', 'Issue #1. Pretty kickass. A little anxious about what happened to the kid.', 'This was not my cup of tea. Something about the storytelling left me not connecting with the characters at all. I was torn between wanting more explanation and being super frustrated with the \"lessons\" at the end of each chapter. The art style didn\\'t appeal to me - it says right there on the back that it\\'s a combination of Eastern and Western comics styles, but somehow I didn\\'t expect cutesy fox kiddies in my elder gods drama. I think I would have loved this better as a book where the worldbuilding would have to be organised differently? The only thing I wholeheartedly enjoyed as an intellectual exercise was that everyone was a woman, except for a few male characters - and the wonky ratio is never explained, exactly as it always happens in male-dominated comics.', \"The captain must go down with her ship. It's what comes back that will be interesting. Love this comic; one of my favs in 2016!\", \"At this point in the series, Spider-Man is running on a kind of happy autopilot. It's not without its charms, but the stories don't really do anything new. Instead, they give Spidey an excuse to swing around, bash thugs, wisecrack and then wonder why his life as Peter Parker is falling apart. \\n This trade hits a high point with a gang war between Doctor Octopus and Hammerhead, a nicely demented villain who's inspired by 1920s gangster flicks and has a solid-steel head. Spidey also tangles with the Gibbon, a D-lister with an animal theme and a hard-luck past, and goes toe-to-toe with the Hulk in Canada. (Maybe they were trying to recapture that Wolverine magic.) \\n It's all ok, but unless you're a completist or a super-fan, you won't miss much if you skip this volume. \\n Read digital versions\", \"I really like this series. It has heart. It's good for all ages.

The Carpenter, a girl who builds traps in supervillains\\' lairs, is tasked with creating a theater with traps so elaborate they will kill Batman. The guy who hires her is meant to be some sort of Hollywood caricature who wants to catch Batman\\'s death on film, but he speaks only in cliches and terrible puns. Seriously, he says \"greenlight\" or \"director\\'s cut\" or \"lights, camera, action\" or some other awful thing in nearly EVERY SENTENCE. And it\\'s not funny! As far as I can tell, it\\'s not even meant to be. Rip those pages out of this book and throw them in the sewer. \\n As for the main storyline focusing on Hush, bleh. Dini\\'s been building up this whole Tommy-Elliott-takes-over-as-Bruce-Wayne storyline for seemingly years, with almost no payoff. It\\'s amazing that an arc as long and tedious as this Hush thing ends as anti-climactically as it does in this book. First of all, Dini can\\'t even finish the story without introducing some stereotypical mobster character who is basically a walking plot device. This mob idiot wants to take revenge on Bruce Wayne because one time 40 years ago Bruce\\'s mom wanted to build a free clinic where the mobster wanted to build apartments or something. I don\\'t know about you, but if I went to jail for 40 years for an unrelated crime, when I got out I don\\'t think I\\'d want to murder the child of someone I barely knew 4 decades previous.

Friends kept forwarding me the wrong ones at the wrong time, I guess. But now it's one of my favorites. And I don't even know that much about history (or Canada). The quirky snark works regardless, plus you end up learning new things. She's a history major who works in a museum, so the scenarios are fact-based, if never the dialog. And the art itself can be just hilarious.\", \"This is Ennis at some of his most Ennis-ish. I can't really say if that is a good or bad thing. I can say that this isn't for the faint of heart. There is a good story here, but there is also a feeling of Ennis and Robertson going for viscous gags first and story second. I think this would have more punch if it weren't mining the same ground as Bendis' Powers in a fairly similar style, at least in terms of supers being pretty much hedonistic jerks. All that said, I am wasting no time in picking up the second trade. \\n Robertson's art is quite strong. Lots of good character acting and he manages to capture the grotesque without it becoming too grossest. Still, between issues his figures sometimes seem to change making it a bit difficult to first identify everyone.\", \"One of the best Graphic Novel I've ever read. The paradox between the serious story of the main characters life, and the realm she mentally lives in is flat out amazing! The art is also very stylized and beautiful in it's own right. I found myself the whole time trying to figure out how they would finish the story in the end, it seemed impossible as the main character got in more and more trouble, but somehow they managed to tie it all together. I would highly and strongly suggest this graphic novel to anyone.\", \"This was a very ambitious project. DC sought to identify the best stories from the Golden Age of Comics told by their original companies (Detective Comics and All American Comics) as well as Quality Comics which was bought out by DC. Unfortunately, at the time of publication, they had some writes issues with republishing stories from Fawcett, so Captain Marvel makes no appearance. \\n The task was not enviable but overall they acquitted themselves well. Most of the usual suspects are here: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Plastic Man, and the Golden Age Green Lantern and Flash along with some lesser known characters such as Kid Eternity, the Sandman, and the Spectre. The Spirit doesn't appear, but there may have been other rights issue in 1990 that the editors didn't address with their introductory material. Also Superboy and Green Arrow are limited to 1-page PSA ads. \\n Among the highlights for me: \\n The origin of Wildcat (from Sensation Comics #1): I'd seen this character on a couple Justice League and Batman: Brave and the Bold cartoons, but his origin story is something else. They generally didn't do origin stories but this one had some real pathos. \\n The Rise and Fall of the Norman Empire (from All Flash Comics #14): I wasn't really impressed with the first Flash comics in the Golden Age Flash Archives, but this collection is something else. It has the Flash battles a mathematical criminal genius who plays cards for the life of the DA. Both Joan Williams and Jay Garrick are pretty well developed as characters in a very fun story. \\n Slam Bradley (from Detective Comics #1);Batman appeared in Detective Comics #27. This helps to answered what appeared before that. Bradley is tough as nails and moves like a steamroller. The story was written by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster as could be told by the art. The story may be un-pc but its actually pretty good. \\n The Black Condor: The President's Been Kidnapped (from Cracked Comics #19): One of the Quality entries, this one is an action packed 9 page thriller that has FDR kidnapped and a puppet whose getting the US to back away from the allies in his place. This really works. There's some great tension and really just an incredible story. \\n Johnny Quick: The Day that Was Five Days Long (from Adventure Comics #144): Johnny gives a bitter man who was sent to jail for five years for a crime he didn't commit his powers, so that he can try all the things he'd wanted to try during the five stolen years. Actually some thought provoking and profound how it plays out. \\n Among my least favorite are: a stupid humor strip called Scribbly the Midget Cartoonist (All American Comics #6), a boring Starman story (Adventure Comics #67), a hard to follow and unengaging story featuring the Vigilante down under (Action Comics #128). The Wonder Woman story wasn't among the greatest and was also hard to get into. \\n The book included a 37-page Justice Society story at the end that was solid for having a team of supervillains in it (the Injustice Society), but also seemed to be struggling with adjusting to 37 page stories rather than 64 pages earlier in the decade as some parts were glossed over with the worst part being Wonder Woman and Johnny Thunder captured off screen. \\n While I disagree with some of the choices, I have to be really impressed with the scholarship shown, there's some introductory and explanatory material with guys who know comics like Roy Thomas, Mark Waid, and Mike Gold taking a hand. \\n With limited items available for reprints, and space limitations, no one could get this perfect. Still, this is a great book for fans of the golden age of comics and a series effort, particularly for its time.\", '3,5', \"Tons of fun. Can't wait for volume 2.\", \"I like the introduction of Mikaila's character, but the actual plot surrounding her was bland. In this volume, Yuki abandons the fairy tale theme to delve into Cain, Riff, and Jizabel's relationships, which is undoubtedly needed, but I believe that so much of the series's success falls on its fairy tale basis. Therefore, I do not feel as invested with the series farther along than when I started. Also, Yuki again has divided up her manga into several choppy stories, instead of keeping it at one, clear, developed story. \\n That said, it was quite interesting to learn about Jizabel's past. It made me appreciate him more as a character, even though he is a crazy antagonist.\", 'Tim is always so excelleeeeeent.', \"I'm glad this story was told in graphic novel form; the visuals were powerful.\", 'I cannot believe that I read several Garfield comics as an adolescent, but my precious cat, Gizmo, resembled Garfield in many ways and I could never resist the comics!', \"Batman is a father and man is his kid annoying.

It is simply a book that like all books is supposed to make you feel something. In this case it is discomfort: these women are unbelievable! They torture, kill, steal, do drugs, DRINK TEARS! It just reminded me of a group of guys from the Mafia or something... And then it hit me. This is the feminine correspondent, something I had never seen portrayed before! \\n And as good as it felt to understand this book, it still didn\\'t compensate for the disappointment it was. I think it would have really gained a lot if it had a little more plot and depth... I mean the drawings are great with their vintage side and all.

Not only does it affect both Rokuro and Benio, but it will change how they approach their future. \\n I like that despite being this 'foretold powerful couple', the twin stars are not immediately all powerful. No, there are other people more powerful than them out there, both good and bad. Having natural talent does not mean that you will immediately be the best, it simply gives them an edge to work together and excel. This is perfectly highlighted and executed and I loved how it worked out. \\n This volume was very emotional. It deals with the past in a major way and it changes how the two main characters see each other as they finally learn all of their biggest secrets. We also learn some secrets from those around them, though I'm sure that won't be the last time. \\n This story goes from plunging me into heartbreaking pain at the loss and grief in the story, to hope for change, and then manages to through in just the right humour to have me giggling again. The story continues to amaze and I can't wait to read more!\", 'Well, I finally decided to get this, despite rarely liking the graphic novel format. I got a bit of Kindle cash to spend for Christmas, and I\\'m a completist who\\'s a serious Patricia Briggs fan. This story is not available any other way, so it kept bugging me that I hadn\\'t read it. (I read Homecoming from the library -- once was enough -- but this one\\'s not anywhere in the Mid-Hudson Library System.) \\n Now I\\'ve read the story -- which was okay, but nothing special -- but since I don\\'t expect I\\'ll ever feel a strong desire to look at it again (and I\\'m a re-re-re-re-reader of my favorites!), I\\'m debating whether I should actually \"return\" it for refund, since I found a number of things unsatisfactory. \\n To start from the beginning, I was annoyed because the large file failed twice to download into my tablet\\'s Kindle app. When it didn\\'t succeed, I decided to simply use Kindle for PC, instead, since (a) it wouldn\\'t take long to read (I\\'m not fond of reading for hours on the desktop monitor), and (b) the larger screen might actually have been a benefit in seeing details, BUT when I tried, a message popped up saying (as closely as I can recall), \"This item is not compatible with the current device\" -- despite the item\\'s page on Amazon.com clearly saying \"Read on any device\"!!! Yes, other, regular, books do open fine in my PC program. So that\\'s misrepresentation, right there, isn\\'t it? Thanks a lot, \"comiXology\" format! Anyway, I did what I had to, clearing space in order for my tablet to download it all the way, and finally it went through, and opened. \\n Okay, the images are sharp, and at least on my big (10\") tablet there was no problem reading the lettering, BUT the depictions are not at all to my taste. I\\'m not even talking about creepy Hopcross Jilly herself, at all; the cover and summary made it quite clear that it was going to be dark-fantasy/horror. \\n * I don\\'t like the way Mercy\\'s and Jesse\\'s faces are drawn more than half the time. Unattractively blobby, too similar, not appropriately native for Mercy, not always looking younger for Jesse, ... \\n * Why is Darryl\\'s wolf drawn like a canine tiger? I can\\'t recall what color fur he\\'s described as having, but if that\\'s meant to be brindle, I have to wonder whether the artist even knows what brindle means. \\n * There\\'s one frame where the human figures are shown over their animal forms, and it looks to me like Darryl\\'s shown as Caucasian, instead of a dark-skinned Chinese-African mix. (Did I misunderstand somehow?) \\n * Adam\\'s wolf has a dark head, not just \"points\" -- I\\'ve never seen a dog or wolf colored like that, either, unless you\\'re talking about a black-&-white fox terrier! \\n *Whose idea was it for Zee to look like Thor ?! Without his glamour, yes, he looks younger and impressive, but he\\'s supposed to look clearly \"other\" and a bit scary, and I believe it said his skin was the color of wood, not human-fair. \\n I could doubtless think of more, but that\\'s enough for the visual aspects. What I most missed was the richness of storytelling -- thoughts, emotions, description, etc. Cartoons are simply a lesser experience for me. A crappy picture is not \"worth a thousand words.\" \\n Even seeing Jesse featured wasn\\'t worth it. It\\'s good to get a look at how she\\'s still having to deal with ostracism and persecution at school (though the \"not letting [her] finish a sentence\" trope always bugs me: if it matters, just shout over the idiot!), but seriously, wouldn\\'t she still trust her instincts re. seeing the \"new girl\" stalking a little boy at the mall w/o having to get second opinions from her dad and stepmom? -- especially since, BTW, she didn\\'t give them any specifics. \\n Overall, the killer was a bit too obvious from the start, and the plot wrapped up too quickly & tidily in the end, after a somewhat overblown \"let\\'s build up suspense\" prolonging of the climax (\"My precious\" cliche time!). \\n The extras in the back, showing the instructions for the illustrator, were somewhat interesting, since they did make me notice a few things I\\'d missed, but if I\\'d been enjoying the artwork, I probably would have spent more time on it. \\n I really want to be able to say, \"Thank you so much for the Kindle gift card; I love the books I got.\" I think I am going to return this, removing it from my account.', \"If I were to rate this book only on the art and the book design, it easily deserves a five. Unfortunately, the story doesn't quite live up to the visual creativity produced by Kim. The book follows Simon and Nancy, two twenty-somethings who are trying to figure out exactly what it means to be a grown-up. In many ways, their tale reminds me of some of the questions and feelings I had only a few short years ago. On the other hand, I was uncomfortable with the thoughtless cruelty of Nancy, and I would have preferred her character arc have been a bit more explicit. Overall, it's a good read, but Kim doesn't get deep enough into these two characters and their growth for the book to be all that affecting for me.

And Jones doesn't disappoint here -- I think this is some of his best work since the beginning of his Batman run with Doug Moench in the mid-90's. Much like that run (and like his Batman: Gotham After Midnight miniseries) there's a Who's-Who of cameos throughout the book, this time with a leaning toward DC's stable of occult characters. The six issues of Dead Don't Sleep, structured as a loosely connected two-parter and four-parter, are perhaps more reliant on Swamp Thing's current place in the DCU than I was ready for (characters who I thought were dead are now alive, vice versa, etc), but otherwise this is a clear spiritual successor to Jones' particular brand of horror-superhero mashup (see Batman: Unseen). \\n Oddly enough, this isn't as strong an entry for Wein, despite the writer's history with Swamp Thing. The dialogue feels neither particularly modern, nor does it hearken to Wein's original ST stories -- it's just sort of there. The handling of multiple plot threads and the round-robin nature of new character intros in each issue just seems clunky. The story has at least three very satisfying major plot twists throughout which genuinely impressed me, but I think Wein could have used more editorial support to make things really shine.\", 'Clever', \"And of course it wouldn't be a real spidey comic without Jameson coming to the rescue, right?\", 'I had to re-read the first part of Gothopia story arc which originally appeared in the special anniversary issue Detective Comics #27 which I read earlier in May. Now that the story is fresh in my mind again, I ventured to read the next two issues that followed it. Now I can\\'t wait to get into this review and start discussing some crucial stuff that really got to me--though these things didn\\'t necessarily hold up once you apply some basic logic into them. I initially thought that the concept for Gothopia is intriguing. In this story, Gotham City is the happiest place in America. Batman and his partner Catbird are crime fighters that maintain the peace and are totes lovers. \\n In the first part of the story featured in issue #27, Poison Ivy is making some ruckus on the peaceful streets of Gotham, asking citizens to open their eyes because they are living a lie. Batman and Catbird come to the rescue and apprehend her, and everyone is back to peachy. EXCEPT IT ISN\\'T. \\n If you haven\\'t started knitting your eyebrows in confusion as I just told you that Gotham City is the happiest place in America and everything is peaceful and freaking Catwoman is called Catbird then you may also be living in an induced mass hallucination courtesy of the Scarecrow. \\n Like I said, the concept for Gothopia was interesting because I\\'ve always had a thing for \"nothing is what it seems\" sorts of stories that are usually surreal and inescapable and reading one in a Batman comic book got me instantly hooked. The revelation that Jonathan Crane a.k.a Scarecrow has somehow managed to put Gotham under a spell as he is aided by other Arkham Asylum neighbors (Harley Quinn, Mr. Freeze, Professor Pyg and the Merrymaker) to \"rehabilitate\" Batman was a promising venture indeed. \\n If you don\\'t think too much about it, this issue was an absolute joy. The pacing flowed smoothly for each scene. Batman in a straightjacket as he is under observation by five of the most insane medical professionals was a memorable scene. Batman teaming up with Poison Ivy to concoct a cure to save everyone from the delusion that Scarecrow has blanketed the entire city in guarantees very amusing and thrilling moments. Batman and Catwoman actually becoming a well-adjusted couple who guard the city from petty crimes but only because it\\'s part of a fantasy version where she\\'s not a thief with flip-flopping priorities and allegiance? Viciously poignant. I must confess that this angle actually made my shipper heart falter a bit. I love Bat-Cat! \\n However, if you examine these elements carefully, some of them fall apart. Gotham City is not exactly closed off the world so how come no one in Metropolis, etc. has noticed that their citizens are acting like they live in a CareBear island of some sort? And how did Scarecrow ever manage to get everyone under a mass hallucination all at once and sustain that? Surely at least ten people will resist the change and start feeling like something\\'s amiss. Batman, being Batman, managed to snap himself out of it but it wouldn\\'t be far-stretched for people in, say, GCPD like Gordon to begin to notice clues here and there. And how can everyone in the city have the same default perspective of their \\'perfect\\' city? After all, Scarecrow just happened to use gas. Shouldn\\'t an airborne virus wash out ESPECIALLY when we see that it had been raining in Gotham for days as well? Like I said, if you become objectively critical about these things, you may enjoy what you\\'re reading less and less. \\n There is only one more issue to go for this thankfully brief story arc. Again, the concept is intriguing but the execution seems rushed and problematic in many areas which is not something I\\'d expect from someone of John Layman\\'s caliber. \\n Anyway, I\\'m hoping he can wrap it up nicely and stick its landing on the next issue. \\n RECOMMENDED: 7/10 \\n DO READ MY BATMAN COMICS REVIEWS AT:', \"Serinuma, an overweight otaku is happy just watching hot guys.

AND IT\\'S INCOMPLETE! I didn\\'t know this going in. The final chapters of the Story of O were not originally published. It was only 10 years later that they were published separately in \"Return to the Chateau\". I just spent all last night and this morning trying to figure it out. It drove me that crazy. Here\\'s why... \\n There\\'s not a page that goes by where someone\\'s not naked or engaging in a sexual act of some sort. It\\'s an erotic novel about a Parisian woman on her journey as a slave. THAT much sex, to me, gets boring. I just don\\'t care after a while. However, with the BDSM dynamic thrown in, there\\'s something larger unfolding that\\'s only hinted at in those last couple of paragraphs that tell you what happens in the suppressed chapters. Something interesting and horrible that saves the book from being shallow pornography. I don\\'t think I\\'ll rate this book without reading the second book, to be honest. It\\'s too important. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be disappointed though. \\n What I did like...so far: BDSM power dynamics is my favorite subject to investigate in human sexuality studies. There are no two stories that are the same. Protocols, levels of submission, who is in control?, who thinks they\\'re in control?...it\\'s fascinating. The Story of O got a lot of backlash from feminists who thought it glorified violence against women. It\\'s just not that simple. Yes, O is debased and beaten, but it\\'s clear that she takes pleasure from it and she is reminded over and over again that she can choose to leave. \"Slave\" is as valid an identity as \"feminist\" and just as much a choice. I think the author anticipated that not everyone would understand this, and that\\'s why we get the character Anne-Marie. It lets readers see that there\\'s not just one dynamic, but many. In this diversity, there is certainly a space where women have an enormous amount of power.', 'Read as individual issues, #1-5', \"Strangehaven is like a soap opera, but with more wierd elements set in a slow, drifting sense of time. \\n Alex Hunter, driving through rural England, swerves to avoid an apparition in the winding country road and ends up in Strangehaven, a gently off-kilter village that he first doesn't want to leave - and then finds himself entirely unable to escape.

I found the combination of straight text and graphic novel style writing a little disruptive.

Okay let\\'s get on with this. \\n First of all, GAY ROMANCE! Yay!!! Those who really know me will tell you quite clearly that all I want out of a book is a gay romance where the fact that they are gay is not mentioned once in the plot in any means other than in casual passing. That\\'s all I want. And I got it! \\n So happy. I definitely love how it was thrown in there and me making a huge point of it is kinda contradictory to my whole motion towards casual gay-ness kind of seem counter intuitive, but let\\'s just roll with it. \\n I really liked the relationship between Nimona and Blackheart, although I would\\'ve liked to see a better resolution than the one we got. I know what they were trying to do, but I would\\'ve preferred a more detailed amount of closure. But again, that\\'s just one of my little reading quirks. \\n The art, goes without saying - fantastic. I loved that there almost seemed to be different tones for each section, and the use of light and dark was executed very well. \\n Let me also just say that at Chapter 10, shit got serious reallllyyyyy quickly. It took a dark turn and then just took everything I thought I\\'d knew got a whole 180 degrees. Suddenly the good people were bad people and the neutral people were good and bad people and the obviously bad people were still being (and that last part I wasn\\'t surprised about - but the rest blew my mind, okay?!?)

You should read it :)', \"347-349: A skrull takes the Fantastic Four out of action and forms a new Fantastic Four with Spider-Man, the Hulk, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider as the members to take on her enemies! \\n This story was pretty superficial. It read like someone called Arthur Adams, the guest penciller, and asked him what he wanted to draw and had Simonson write a story around it. Skrulls, Mole Man, and lots of monsters. I suspect Wolverine and Ghost Rider were members of the surrogate Fantastic Four solely to drum up sales. It's a pretty good example of a soulless 1990's Marvel story. Shame on you, Walt! \\n 350: Doctor Doom and his doom bots attack Latveria to unseat Kristoff. Things are going well until another Doctor Doom shows up. And Ms. Marvel makes a deal with the devil to regain human form. \\n And things are back to status quo, not just for the Fantastic Four but for Doctor Doom as well with Kristoff out of the picture. There seemed to be a shot taken at Steve Englehart when Doctor Doom talked about Ms. Marvel's origin. \\n 352-354: As the remainder of the Fantastic Four battle Doctor Doom's defenses, Reed and Doom battle across time in a duel to the death until the Time Variance Authority get involved. \\n Funny how the top guys in the TVA look like the late Mark Gruenwald, the guy in charge of Marvel's continuity. With all the time travel that goes on in the Marvel Universe now, the TVA could use a monthly title just to clean up after it. \\n Closing Thoughts: Walter Simonson's run was a return to big stories featuring Marvel's First Family but they didn't really break any new ground and didn't accomplish much more than hitting the reset button. This last volume was a little weak but still gets a three out of five stars.\", '\"Make voyages. Attempt them. There\\'s nothing else.\" -Tennessee Williams, Camino Real \\n \"Why are you walking the Camino? \\n \"Well, I just turned fifty. It was either the Porsche or the Camino. I chose the Camino.\"--Jason (this is the one joke he tells along the way; sometimes he gets laughs for it.) \\n Jason is one of my absolute favorite cartoonists ever. I have read everything I could get my hands on and am in the process of owning everything now, too, which is at this point rare for me to do with any author. Jason, a Norwegian cartoonist living in the south of France, turned 50 and decided--though he is not a Christian nor in any obvious way to me spiritual--to walk the Camino Real in Spain, a more than 30 day venture, over 800 km. He grew up in Norway disinterested in nature, and only in recent years, he says, began to notice nature at all. But he walked the walk, doing something unlike anything he had ever done. \\n Jason is a master of minimalism, a simple storyteller with a dry sense of humor. And he draws all his characters--including himself in this, his first autobiographical comic--as animals. Always has done this. Most of his comics are funny and deft and clever, and this is the first long-form comic he has done. So there are many pages without any deft observations or deep insights. Which is what it must have been for him and many others. One foot after the other, no spiritual Saul-on-the Damascus-road epiphanies, sorry. It\\'s not The Snow Leopard by Peter Matthiessen! \\n Early on in the book things move slowly, and on a quick read you might say the things you learn most about the Camino Real are bedbugs, blisters, snoring in hostels, Cafe con Leche, small talk with people he meets. Yawn. So if you aren\\'t religious.. . . what is this thing but a long walk? Yet we get to know Jason in a way we don\\'t in any of his other comics. He\\'s an introvert, he goes days without talking to anyone, but gradually, gradually makes some connections. His goal would seem to be a modest one: To be more open with others, and in this quest he is successful. And in the process he depicts little amusing fantasies that he has about taking a machine gun to bugs, things like this. He\\'s funny, he\\'s sweet. He likes old movies and Hemingway, references pop culture all the time. He\\'s everyman, not St.Augustine, which is kind of the point about this book\\'s accessibility, I think. \\n At one point a couple travelers want to videotape him for a YouTube video they are making of all the people they meet along the way. He says no, he just doesn\\'t want to be on YouTube. . . but then recognizes the hypocrisy of saying that while planning to put this incident in his book of the trip. \\n Then, he jokes, \"If he had asked me, can I draw you as a dog {reminder: Jason draws himself as a dog in this graphic memoir!] that says, \\'Hi, I\\'m John, from Norway!\\' I would have said, \\'Sure! Go ahead!\\' So there!\" \\n There\\'s a near-final image where he depicts himself whistling as he passes a graveyard, and then several wordless panels follow of just him walking along, wordless. \\n I\\'m not now religious, though I see myself as spiritual. I\\'m putting the Camino Real on my bucket list. Jason says he will make this walk again, and I would be happy to do it with him, either through reading of it or actually walking with him. Either will be fine with me.', \"Maybe it's because nearly a year has passed since I read the last volume, but this really felt like a return to form. \\n The last couple of books had characters everywhere, with different objectives, and it felt scattered. New characters were being introduced at an alarming rate, and minor characters were getting lost in the shuffle. Quite a dramatic event happened at the end of the fifth volume, and it took me a while to remember who the character involved was, which was clearly not intended reaction. \\n This volume, however, is much more focused, and it's dropped a lot of the soap opera nonsense that had started to crop up in the plot. It skips forward a few years in the future, which is something I often find annoying in stories, but this time it felt like a welcome palate cleansing break. The child narrator is now an adorable four-year-old, and her parents are desperately trying to find her. She is currently trapped with a family member in a high-security prisoner-of-war camp, so the story has a fun heist vibe while re-establishing the characters and plotline. \\n There is a side plot of people tracking the parents and their child, which is less interesting but not unbearable. It adds tension and will hopefully come into its own without muddling the main storyline again, but I thought in this volume the balance between the viewpoint characters worked really well. \\n I was starting to drift from this series a little, but I'm back on the hype train. I'm eager to get to the next volume, but I have a feeling it won't be coming out until early next year. \\n More reviews can be found on my book blog.\", \"I haven't been completely under a rock, I've known about this book and have been meaning to get to it for years.

She wants to go to art school, her mom wants her to go to a regular college and major in business. The story covers a downward spiral of feeling left out, being angry, hating school, and focusing on escape via a long-distance love connection. \\n I didn't connect with the main character, because of the amount of outward anger she has toward everything in her life. Her actions were alienating to the other characters in the novel, and also to me. The author does a good job portraying the shortsightedness of being this age, where every little thing that goes wrong feels like it will WRECK EVERYTHING FOREVER, but still. Self-absorbed alienation in a protagonist is difficult to like.\", 'This book I chose for BookTube-A-Thon challenge number 4: Read the last book you acquired. \\n I liked this comic but some parts I was like wth', 'A', 'I enjoyed this book, but I wish it would have given more information about the transition to life after leaving East Berlin. I felt like the story should have continued for another 50 pages or so; the ending was way too abrupt.', \"I liked it. The story is compelling, the characters are awesome, and the art is really good. Ending every issue with an essay on Feminism is a great bonus, especially when they're beautifully written (also the Q&As, which remind you of the importance and the rarity of such a book to exist), but I'm only going to review the comics part of this volume for now. \\n Even though I really enjoyed it, I felt like there's a major flaw in the setting of the story. \\n It seems like we're in a dystopian future, but it doesn't feel like it. Usually in a dystopia, the writer finds out a pattern in our society's evolution and exaggerates it in the future, putting a mirror in front of our eyes, to scare us from what's to come. However, here, we have a 1950's society but with a better technology for oppressing women this time. I'm not saying that misogyny is gone, but I'm sure we're not on our way to having women shipped out to another planet. Or at least, not anymore. \\n It's a pretty cool set up, but usually when a writer doesn't want to follow the natural evolution of a society, they would insert a major event that would destroy Earth as we know it, so they'd be able to introduce their own logic, and suggest whatever consequences they want. Everything in this comic is really accurate, yet farfetched at the same time, because the backstory was not established (a sort of Deus ex Machina slipped at the beginning of the story). \\n I wonder what happened in this parallel universe that made Planet Bitch justifiable and women so disposable. \\n The series is still at its beginning, so maybe they'll be clearing up some of the issues in the volumes to come. There's a lot of potential in here. I will keep checking in, the story is still gripping and the character development very interesting, and of course the extended backmatter is the crown jewel.\", 'this appealed to me as someone with a love of ghost stories, and also as someone that was once upon a time an angsty suburban russian american teenage girl.', 'Enjoyed the perspective of an outsider in North Korea.

Though they have been together for years, their relationship is now on the rock as the two people try to understand the role of their ethnicity in their lives and relationships. The main male character finds Caucasian women to be more attractive than Japanese women, which his girlfriend believes is racist. The couple decides to separate when Ben\\'s girlfriend goes away to NYC. After some failed relationships and one-night stands, Ben decides to follow her only to find that she is hiding her own secret (though it is an extremely anti-climatic secret). Ben discusses all of her personal issues with his Korean best friend who is a lesbian with a revolving door of girlfriends. \\n Though issues surrounding identity and the role of ethnicity in a person\\'s life are certainly worthy of exploration, this graphic novel does not handle the material as well as other novels (graphic and otherwise). The characters appear insipid and shallow. Ben\\'s best friend is portrayed as a stereotypical lesbian character with a new girlfriend each night. Ben himself is depicted as a \"typical\" male who tries to find himself by sleeping with and drooling over other women besides his girlfriend. His girlfriend is also a two-dimensional character who flees the relationship by literally moving away. The graphics are interesting and all in sepia which adds a melancholic mood. Still, the pictures are not that interesting and do not add much to the text. \\n Overall, I was disappointed by this selection and found both the text and pictures to be lacking.

This was an obvious jab at all the atrocities of Twilight, it was a weekend comic put together by Petrucha and his daughter and it was funny, it was light and it was quick. \\n I have still yet to find a parody that I enjoy without thinking \"well, that\\'s just stupid and obvious\", but Breaking Down was an entertaining read for those of us that have read the Twilight series and who will be able to pick up on the major jokes but also a lot of the subtle and well hidden ones. \\n Breaking Down was a light, funny and playful approach to the Twilight saga. \\n Find this review at storywings.com', 'Devo dirlo: la storia mi e sembrata fin troppo veloce verso la fine.

In volume 1 we got an excellent depiction of the history behind the Iranian revolution and in this volume Satrapi shows us what it was like for her in Europe after fleeing Iran and then coming back. The culture changes, the feeling of belonging nowhere. Because of that this novel touched me more than the first. I completely understand her as I also left my Island for the United States at age 11 and that feeling of not belonging anywhere is shared with a lot of immigrants. You don't belong in the Western countries but you also don't fit in with those people who never left. \\n I absolutely love Satrapi's honesty and her hard-hitting moments from admitting her homelessness in Europe to her attempt at suicide in her dark depression. I love that every step of the way Satrapi criticizes her own government, that she keeps pushing and is vocal about woman's rights and in the mists of her advocacy she just wants to be loved by a man and feel wanted. \\n A lot of good stuff going on in these novels, I highly, highly recommend the duology if you have yet to pick it up.

Het bracht een soort nieuw perspectief tot me, over de Iraanse en Irakese oorlog, over hoe het is om in een cultuur te leven die eigenlijk niet bij je past, en over vrijheid. Dat dit het levensverhaal is van Marjane maakt het des te krachtiger als statement. Ik heb het gevoel alsof mijn ogen zijn geopend. Er is een nieuw perspectief duidelijk gemaakt, waardoor ik anders tegen mezelf, maar ook cultuurverschil aankijk. Door de media zijn we geneigd vooroordelen te hebben over Iran, dus dat was er bij mij als klein meisje ook al in gestopt. Door deze comic te lezen, maar ook door mijn studie en veranderende perspectief, heb ik het gevoel alsof ik meer geleerd heb over Iran en cultuurverschil dan ieder school- of geschiedenisboek dat kon doen. \\n Dan, over de schrijf- en tekenstijl.

Granted, I could learn much more about her, and any other piece of history, from a regular history book, but I don't need to study every aspect of history.

And she\\'s still looking for something that she can own, that she can be...well herself in. Then she gets introduced to Caorsegold Online, a massively-multiplayer role-playing game where she is a fighter, a leader...a hero. She\\'s part of an all girl gaming group and although she\\'s a probie, she\\'s begun to prove how valuable she is. Everything is going so well...and then...she befriends a gold farmer, a poor Chinese kid whose only goal is to illegally collect and sell valuable objects. And while this is against the rules of Coarsegold and what she has been fighting against, Anda soon realizes that the lines between right and wrong are blurred when real life shows up to play. \\n Lately the book world has been clamoring, begging, for more diversity in characters and more of a look at, well real world topics. And here \"In Real Life\" delivers both in spades. Not only do we have strong female characters in this book that are smart, intelligent, kickass gamers, they don\\'t leave who they are in the digital world. They take it into the real world with them, to stand up for what they believe in. In this book Anda comes to that point in life where she starts to question and realize that just because there is a difference between right and wrong, that they are not always black and white. That there are shades of a spectrum and there are reasons for everything, even if we don\\'t always like them. So then the question becomes...what do we do about it? And that\\'s the question that Cory and Anda answer, or attempt to answer. Even better though is that Anda doesn\\'t just make these changes in the gaming world...in the real world to she stands up for what she believes in and grows as a character as we read. Throughout the book, beginning, middle, end, Anda is a character to look up to and admire...and maybe even emulate. \\n I do think that it says something that Anda chooses an avatar that is almost opposite of her: white, red haired, and slimmed. What it says...well I\\'m not sure that I\\'m the best person to answer that question, but Jen Wang does not make such choices in character design lightly. Nor is she one to make such a choice to encourage this is what all gamers do. I think she\\'s making a subtle, but powerful statement of her own about what we do and how we live, both in the digital world and the real world. And when the traits of the two start to merge...maybe things are bound to change. Jen Wang\\'s artwork is beautiful, rich and textured. She creates two distinct palettes with one being reserved for \"the real world\" which is muted and somewhat somber and the gamer world which is bright and vivid. I\\'ve loved Jen\\'s work since \"Koko Be Good\" and she\\'s only gotten better since then and really shines here. But I love, love the character design and the way the character\\'s move on the page. They are vibrant and animated in battle, in dance, or in just standing up for themselves whether to other players, their parents, or themselves. \\n Given everything that has gone on in gamer world recently this is an important book and Anda is a great character to look up to. Cory and Jen have created a work that should be on every library\\'s shelf and be handed out for everyone to read, about gaming, about reality, about life whether young or old or somewhere in between. I give the book 5 out of 5 stars.', \"A new graphic novel by the New Zealander Dylan Horrocks, who wowed the world with his graphic novel Hicksville way back in 1998, but has not produced much on note since. \\n This is yet another meta-comic, just like Hicksville, about a comics artist - a thinly disguised avatar for Horrocks, who has lost his ability to create and is drawn into worlds created by a magical pen. It's a fun and intelligent play on writers block, and just like Scott McCloud's new, eagerly anticipated graphic novel The Sculptor, which was also a long time coming, it's nigh perfect when it comes to the craftsmanship, but just a little distanced, a little unemotional. Maybe this was intended by Horrocks, as part of the story is about the artist Sam Zabel loosing his ability to burn brightly for his art, but it lacks the ability to really grab hold of me emotionally. \\n That said, as this is yet another foray into the strange and wonderful world of Horrocks, where nothing is as it seems, and the line between reality and comics is always blurry, reading this together with Hicksville, which I'm bound to do now since it been way too long, will probably reveal more levels built into The Magic Pen, referring back to Hicksville, which I missed out on. \\n The fact that the first part of the book is not a little sexist, and that the second part is full of excuses about that, trying desperately to make up for the initial part, makes me think that there have been versions of this book in the works for a long time. It all works, and the book feels like it fits into the more equal minded 2010s, but there is just that nagging feeling that this was not fully intended from the start. \\n Oh well, for comics fans, this is an interesting read, and if you already have read Hicksville, then I'd say it's a must.\", \"Full review to come once I've finished processing.

This makes for an interesting story, because Valley is...different. As Joker put it:\"The ferocity...the lack of grace..the sheer brutality...\" Batman\\'s costume becomes metallic and ferocious.

And then, after he leaves the killer Abattoir and his innocent hostage for dead, Bruce Wayne reappears (mysteriously healed and with missing backstory), too weak to do anything about it. Thus ends volume 2. \\n I found the beginning and end to be slow - Valley is a commanding enough character, but all types of villians and new plotlines were thrown at him, and it was hard to keep up. I bet DC wanted to keep Valley from interacting with too many classic characters, because they can always detect his fake-ness. So instead he has all these new or obscure guys popping up.

I reread the first book before taking on this new volume, something I recommend. These books don\\'t take all that long to read, and you get a better feel for what Batista is aiming for when you read the whole story so far in one go. \\n In this second volume we get a direct continuation from the end of volume one: the prince is rescued, but needs to be taken to his mother, the Queen, in order for the warrior princess to get her reward. On the way they encounter female highway robbers, who try to kidnap the prince for their own purposes, and the princess\\'s overbearing older sister, who tries to rape the poor little prince. \\n The style seems to be a mix of shojo and shonen inspiration and is extremely well executed, especially considering that these books are done in, for Sweden, break-neck speed of one volume a year. On the one hand, I\\'ve always been a bit mystified by the urge of non-japanese artists to imitate the style of Japanese comics down to the last detail, on the other I realise that doing so opens up the whole world as your market. \\n I ended my review of the first volume by asking for something a bit more original besides the gender changing, since much of the story, if you change back the gender roles, is fairly standard fantasy stuff. In this volume I got just that, when Batista let the two main characters physically change gender during a scene where they take a bath in a magical pool of water in a forest and both come up as the opposite sex. This is of course a nod and a wink to all the gender-bending and gender-swapping in original manga in general, and in particular to Rumiko Takahashi\\'s classic Ranma 1/2. Great fun! \\n I must admit that Batista\\'s ambition to make the reader think about traditional gender roles in fantasy works. As a male reader, I cringed when reading about how the young prince was treated. To paraphrase my favourite author, Terry Pratchett, which seems appropriate since he is one of the few fantasy writers I know of who writes egalitarian if not superior female characters, and his maybe greatest creation Granny Weatherwax: those are my First thoughts, based on years and years of consuming traditional fantasy. But then my Second thoughts kicks in, reminding me that this IS fantasy, where everything\\'s possible. There\\'s even bloody dragons! And then my Third thoughts scream: \"Fuck yeah!! \\n Oh well, on a more serious note (or actually that was rather serious) this is the kind of fantasy I will want my daughter to read in about ten years time (she\\'s one year old right now).

There was a deep, intense sadness throughout. Surprisingly heartbreaking. I was quite drawn to it. \\n The third was a satirical look at action hero movies, which focused on Jesse's uncles, Jody & TC. This was okay, but definitely my least favorite out of the three! \\n Even though this takes away from the main storyline with Jesse, Cassidy & Tulip, it was nice to have a more fleshed out view of some of the important supporting characters.

Beau Smith was trying for an \"old west meets Buffy\" vibe that is quite interesting, but the artists for the story were trying for a \"sex sells\" vibe, which isn\\'t quite the same thing. For the interior art, the main character is drawn to be as endowed and exposed as possible, but on the cover it\\'s beyond ridiculous. If she puts those pistols back in the holsters, her pants will make her pants fall down, among other things. \\n That said, the idea that the justice department would have special federal marshals equipped to handle the supernatural makes sense, if you assume a world in which the supernatural is known to exist. Having a descendant of Wyatt Earp who is in law enforcement is also not a stretch. The whole thing fits, and is fun. Not great, but fun.

As a recent library school grad, this was a refreshing reminder of information literacy and how to spread the knowledge.

Highly recommend to readers interested in learning more about info lit, though take it slow.

It presents an exciting missing chapter in the story that occurs chronologically between Firefly and Serenity. The story was engaging and very nicely done, giving the reader the feel of watching an episode of Firefly. The characterizations are true to the television series. In fact, the dialog was so well done, I could almost hear the actors voices in each role. The artwork was very well rendered. I particularly liked the portraits of each of the characters that are scattered throughout the book. I thought that they were very accurate depictions of their real-life actor counterparts. Since the book is part of a continuing story, it may not be of much interest to those who have not seen the series or the movie, as it would probably be hard to follow. In my opinion however, this book is a must-have for fans of Firefly or Serenity.', \"This is a solid adventure graphic novel and I expect it to fly off the shelves. It's the first book in a new series, but it stands alone nicely.

Rumor has it something sinister lurks in the tunnel and the children collectively decide a sacrifice is necessary. A young girl is cast into the tunnel and barely survives. 10 years later, the same school children, their teachers and parents all must face the choices they made in the past. The story shifts back and forth between the intertwining storylines, which makes for an occasionally confusing narrative. The tone of this graphic novel is far less frenetic than most of the manga that makes it to the US. The pacing and plotting is far more deliberate as well. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous and makes this black-and-white graphic novel seem utterly luminous - a rare feat indeed. I didn't quite love this graphic novel, but I certainly appreciate the style, both of the narrative and the illustration.\", 'When I read this (and The Epiplectic Bicycle) to my little sister this morning (previously having retold her one of Lovecraft\\'s stories I\\'d recently read), she said: \"Oh, now [Gorey] is my 2nd favourite writer, right after Lovecraft!\" Mission accomplished :) \\n This is a dark, short, illustrated story in rhyme.

They all have their strengths but the plot looks like revolves around Maria the scientist and Robin the folklore magician (just don\\'t call him a wizard).

Nevertheless, this is a Calvin & Hobbes collection and so it's automatically highly recommended and moreso because it's both the greatest hits and you get a bit of history too. Superb stuff.\", 'The Best We Could Do brings to life author Thi Bui\\'s search for a better future while longing for a simpler past. This beautifully illustrated and emotional story explores the anguish of immigration and the lasting effects that displacement has on a child and her family. \\n Alternating between the present, Bui\\'s own childhood in California, and the lives of her parents amid the chaos of the Vietnam War, Bui explores the saga of her country while trying to understand the history of her parents and grandparents. Their struggles and pain reflect the turmoil within a country that whiplashed the French Colonial rule to Communism to civil war in one generation. \\n At the heart of Bui\\'s story is a universal struggle: While adjusting to life as a first-time mother, she ultimately discovers what it means to be a parent--the endless sacrifices, the unnoticed gestures, and the depths of unspoken love. \\n I think by now it\\'s no secret that I get utterly mesmerized with memoirs, particularly when told in the graphic novel format. So I was practically giddy with excitement and triumph when I received this finished copy in the mail courtesy of the publisher. Seriously, though, \"beautiful\" doesn\\'t even begin to encompass how exquisite and ethereal this graphic novel is in real life. \\n #Goals. \\n Speaking of which, the inside of it was just as eye-catching. Thi Bui\\'s dreamlike artwork, reminiscent of Mariko Tamaki\\'s This One Summer, beautifully and poignantly captures many quiet and loud moments, such as growing up, fitting in, and the connection between generations of family.

It was incredible to witness. Wonders will never cease. \\n The above is such a powerful page. \\n Needless to say, I got educated and enlightened a whole lot while reading this illustrated memoir told through the eyes of Bui\\'s family escaping the fall of South Vietnam and fighting to build a new life. The revelation of an often-untold side of the Vietnam War and of refugees trying to escape and create a better life is one I find vitally important, especially in this day and age. Plus, Bui\\'s storytelling skills are just phenomenal; I barely noticed time creeping by until I reached the ending in one sitting. \\n Tackling a wide range of evergreen issues, such as parenthood, immigration and displacement, I\\'d highly recommend you give this graphic novel a go! \\n ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. \\n Expected publication: March 7th, 2017 \\n 5/5 stars \\n Note: I\\'m an Amazon Affiliate.

A lot of this documentation is reproduced in this book together with the final drawings, so you quickly get a feel of professionalism Herge showed in all of his work. This is clearly the main team of this companion. \\n While guiding the reader through the complete works, Farr does not neglect to describe some of the personal problems Herge had to deal with during his career. Although Farr gives most of the time his personal view on topics such as Herge working for a newspaper led by Nazis during the occupation of Belgium and the break-up of Herge's marriage, the author still gives the readers enough room for their own opinions.

I really loved the artwork, and could see the influence by Tim Burton and Edward Gorey throughout the book. There are very deep moments about life and death in the book, with artwork that matches the mood and meaning perfectly. I enjoyed it. However, I do not think I would share it with my son. I certainly would not recommend it for you children, or those of any age with younger siblings. This is certainly for adults, teens, and maybe some mature tweens, but not younger readers. \\n Billy is a smart, if a little morbid, boy. That I have no issue with, however he also lashes out often and is just mean to other people and animals- alive or dead. While he does confess that he loves his little sister and write a letter to Santa Claus, his impulse to be mean seem to regularly outweigh any other emotions he might have. While this makes for moments of drama, entertainment, and revelation, it is not something I want to encourage in my son or other children. \\n Billy Fog Volume 1: The Gift of Trouble Sight is a work with great artistic merit and an interesting read.

Every page is illustrated, and there is some text to go along with it. It does make a kind of interesting, piecemeal narrative, but it just didn't appeal to me all that much.

Aside from Fujiwara no Sai, the series has been basically free of fantasy elements, which makes sense, though it leaves Sai as basically a plot device who doesn\\'t really fit now that Hikaru no longer needs a ghostly tutor to nudge him into playing and improving. \\n So, in this volume Sai disappears. And Hikaru freaks out, and goes looking for him, searching out what were supposedly his old (corporeal) haunts in Hiroshima. This volume is more road trip than go contest, though we finally get some interaction between Hikaru and Akira Toya. \\n It will be interesting to see whether Hotta has really written Sai out of the series entirely, or if the ghost will be back. Also to see what effect this has on Hikaru. However, the immediate effect, that Hikaru goes totally emo, bawls his head off, and decides to quit playing go, had me going, \"Huh?\" I mean, it\\'s great that the kid finally learns a lesson about taking other people for granted - he\\'s been a real jerk to everyone, especially Sai, though no more so than most teenagers. But considering how he treated Sai more as a pest and/or a pet than a friend, his sudden overwhelming depression when Sai vanishes did not ring true. \\n Anyway, I guess it does make a convenient excuse to delay the Hikaru/Akira showdown a while longer, but dang, let\\'s bring some tense go games back into the plot.', 'Wow, a unique voice expressed mostly in pictures.

But this story just doesn't feel like zombies, because the Revivers still have their mental faculties (for the most part? This is another debated point) and humanity isn't facing down the shambling hordes. On the other hand, the human drama of Wassau shows that just because the Revivers aren't mindless doesn't mean they can't kill tons of their living friends, relatives, and neighbors. In fact, this trade has the first mass killing, which was unexpected and hinged on a betrayal. The effects are devastating and the trade wraps up with the fate of the Revivers in ambiguous hands. \\n The focus of this trade is predominantly Martha's story, and picking on her plot thread is like going to an anti-Wonderland. Honestly, Martha's story in this trade is the stuff of nightmares in the slow, creeping terror of how it's playing out as well as a reminder that no one, no matter how normal-seeming, is sane in Wassau. A niggling question from the last trade: dead girls can get knocked up? Who? What? And did I miss a detail about how some people have a true death while others Revive?

While Death hunts the Chosen of the Horsemen down, the Horsemen hunt him. \\n In this alternate history, religion and sci-fi come together within the setting of a western. It bares all the usual traits that make a western appealing, including: grit, gunfights, natives, drama, and a tough-guy hero. There are differences though, such as a female lead who is iron-willed, and unforgiving. It is from her union with Death, that East and West meet. \\n The art switches between the gritty violence, and the more flashy display of colours that the rest uses. Amidst all these hues and the blood are Death and his partners. All three stand out in their clean whiteness that represents the finality of life. \\n The author reveals information only at the exact moment it is needed, so its takes a while before we gleam what the story is exactly. At its core, it is a western revenge story that would not normally stand out. However, its near-perfect execution, as well as the additional non-western elements, set it into a class of its own.

I thought Doran's treatment not only fairly superficial, but also that the pictures did not particularly add anything to the story, especially during the last 30 or so pages, which present Casement's trial summation verbatim and just alternates between shots of him and reaction shots of the courtroom. If one didn't already know a lot about Casement, I would think this would be hard to follow, unless one read the three page synopsis of his life at the END of the book first.

When I picked up this first book in the Marquis Of Anaon series I had not a clue as to what it was about, but within a handful of pages I was hooked. It's historical setting, the bleakness of the lives of the islanders, the mystery of the circumstances and its innocent and well-meaning hero shape a scenario that keeps you on that figurative edge of your seat. Is this a book about simple folk struggling with the paranormal, or is it the fact that they know no better that it's the only conclusion they can draw? Is it a book that embraces the supernatural as a narrative device or simply toys with our collective fascination to string us all along? \\n Jean-Baptiste is a young man offered employment on the Isle of Brac to tutor the Baron's son, but from the boat journey that delivers him there he's quickly aware that something isn't quite right. However, being young and unexperienced, who is he to judge the behaviour and social conduct of others, especially when things turn nasty on the quayside and violence flares. By the time Jean-Baptiste reaches the Baron's residence he learns that the son, Nolwen, has run off and is nowhere to be found, and it's some time until he is located, supposedly killed from a fall from his horse that dragged him some distance. However, Jean-Baptiste has some medical training and notices inconsistencies with this explanation. Unable to leave the island, Jean-Baptiste must delve deeper into the superstitions and fear of the islanders, and a ghostly presence in the woods, to make sense of what's going on; and his own life depends on it. \\n On its own the story itself would be an intriguing tale to read, but Matthieu Bonhomme's artwork is the icing on the cake. His style isn't over-worked, and complemented by Delf's colours it is suitably sinister and atmospheric. His portrayal of Jean-Baptiste avoids the usual square-jawed, muscle-bound hero stereotype, and instead gives us a youthful innocent bewildered and yet determined. His style reminded me much of the excellent Eduardo Risso of 100 Bullets fame. \\n Exactly what this book is about, and what the series promises to be, I'll leave for to discover, but I will say that this is an excellent opening chapter that I can't imagine anyone will be disappointed by.\", \"Taking the classic story out of the woods and into Depression era New York is a brilliant idea.

Steel Ball Run is more of a spin-off set in an alternate universe where things work very differently to the main-line story arcs: stands are rarely visible, hamon is replaced by what the main characters call The Spin and the writing takes a turn for the better, keeping both the cheese factor and the shoe-horned plot twists to a minimum. \\n I'm relatively new to the series, but this is my favorite part so far.

She comes from a home that is struggling for money to the point where they are trying to decide which extra things they can cut from their bills, such as the internet or electricity.

Manga is made by the Japanese and their art has distinct characteristics; it can be distinguished from cartoons, manhwas, marvel, and other art styles.

The whole illustration, however, is very pleasing. \\n The artist's style is melodramatic and extravagant. It captures the different personalities and emotions of the characters. The artist relies too much on chibi (dwarf-like characters) which somewhat loses its entertaining purpose. But, the mini chibi comic strips are amusing. The intricacy of details is what I like the most--from the tresses of their hairs to the creases of their clothes. \\n The lines get a little modern and some scenes deviate from the original.

I loved it then, and I still love it today. For all the excessive drama, and overly-damaged characters, I still feel that it sits at an entirely different level to every other manga I\\'ve read. This isn\\'t silly or funny. It isn\\'t a classic \\'comic\\'. It\\'s a beautiful, wrenching look into the human psyche. The stunning artwork combined with genuine character development combine to create something extraordinary. \\n I could have easily studied this book both in my English class and in my Art class at school, it explores so many interesting and challenging questions in such a fascinating way. \\n It also feels like a little cultural snapshot into the time period it was written. There\\'s a lot of apathy here (at least initially) towards the future. You get a sense from the combined artwork and dialogue that everything is in a state of decay - there\\'s an odd dystopic vibe. Yet it makes those little pockets of beauty all the more meaningful. I think it would be interesting to take a look at the financial, environmental and business reports from the time period this story was written, and compare it to the attitude of the characters. I suspect you would find a lot of parallels. A sense of the \"golden period\" coming to an end, and the future being uncertain. \\n Heh, just look at the review I\\'m writing here. If anything proves that this book is thought-provoking, then that should. It\\'s turning me philosophical. \\n It\\'s such a perfect coming-of-age story. So many of the characters are broken, but really, who isn\\'t? We all have our baggage and our problems. We all have moments when we want to switch off and just stop caring. We can all see parts of ourselves reflected in these characters. So it\\'s nice to see how people change. How what you thought was strong is weak, and how a weakness can become a strength. And it\\'s nice to see how you can get to the other side, and find happiness after all. \\n An easy 5 stars for this series. Recommended for wanting to read a beautiful, thought-provoking romance. However do note that this story includes suicide, rape, mental illness, and both emotional & physical abuse.', \"Just couldn't stop reading right after the first issue. Warren Ellis created an anti-hero in Spider Jerusalem that I can relate to. A mind bending futuristic tale, that deals with politics and society, it raises many thought provoking questions through the protagonist's harsh (but mostly hilarious) commentary and keeps the reader engaged for hours. Its innovative, it's something new and definitely something I'd recommend.\", '4.5 stars.', \"At first I was a little disappointed in this volume and thought I wasn't going to like it at all. Silly me, I thought it was going to continue with the story of the early Justice League and maybe how the League is going to encounter Pandora (since she was in the epilogue). That's totally not how it went down. At first, I felt like it was just jumping all over the place and I didn't know how Green Arrow was going to fit in. He doesn't. He's only in the first half of this graphic novel and then is nowhere to be seen for the last half. That kind of aggravated me. I didn't necessarily want him to join since there is already one mouthy green dude in the league but I didn't feel like the story connected well. Steve offers him some other job and then boom he is MIA for the rest of the volume. I'm guessing that means he's going over to some other comic series team? Maybe. \\n The second story was badass and dark. The super friends get into a super fight all because of this big bad dude named Graves. Steve is in trouble and Wonder Woman is not about to sit around and think of a plan or discuss their options which leads to a huge fight and the whole world watches as the Justice League falls apart. Graves was a pretty awesome bad guy. I like bad guys where you can understand their motives. Grief can lead you to do some pretty horrible things. \\n The end of the novel left a huge cliff hanger and I can't wait to find out what happens.\", 'I thought the Days of Future Past story line would be more substantial. Only 2 of the 6 issues included in this volume relate to the titular plot.', 'I have tried, unsuccessfully, to read several graphic novels (Watchmen, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), but I could never get past one or two pages: the stories seemed all violence and no substance or the writing was just too bare or the characters were completely unrelatable or I couldn\\'t gleam meaning from the pictures... \\n Then I read Y: The Last Man (Book 1: Unmanned and Book 2: Cycles). The premise: some unknown cause (referred to as \"The Plague\") has wiped out every male, human and otherwise, except for one man (Yorick) and his male capuchin monkey (Ampersand). The story intelligently explores what the world would look like without men; adroitly painting a picture of the still very current division of labor by gender. Cycles has a very thoughtful commentary on the American penal system. It is chock full of drama, humor, and wit; thought povoking and entertaining. It is also wildly liberal - you have been forewarned. Truly fantastic! With the exception of the drawings of the women, which predictably depict main character women as thin and conventionally beautiful, and often unnecessarily scantily clad, the illustrations are fantastic. They contribute to the story (for example, noticing the small superhero action figure on the floor of Yorick\\'s room definitely adds to his characterization) but you do not have to rely on the illustrations to understand the story, something that causes me trouble in other graphic novels! It may be that a seasoned graphic novel reader would feel very differently about this series, but as a newbie who has had trouble with the genre, I was quite pleased!', \"I liked this volume MUCH better than its previous ones. Perhaps it was the introduction and development of strong characters - Emeline, Meridiana, Gilbert, etc. They were likable and static. I also love the lore of Jack the Ripper - it's scary, gory, and interesting. Again, the manga's success lies in a single story instead of several small ones, giving it enough time to fully develop. I can't wait to see how the Cain Saga concludes! \\n In this volume, I have begun to see a change in Yuki's art. It's gotten much better, though there are still many scenes where it looks like her old style. It's amazing how Godchild #1 and the Cain Saga #1 are so different in art style, which is a big deal for me with how I end up liking the manga (most likely, if the art sucks, it'll drop my liking of it by at least fifty percent).\", \"It's entertaining but felt a little jumbled.\", 'Mission: catch up on the last decade\\'s worth of Inhumans.

Round two: bridge between Jenkins Inhumans glacial primer and the War Of Kings event. \\n Weird.

I just didn't understand all the internet hype around Gillen, Kid Loki, and JiM in general. \\n This volume, a crossover between JiM and the Mighty Thor, brings Gillen's arc to a close, brings Kid Loki's story full circle in more ways than one, and finally feels like a real, full, epic storyline in itself. I finally get the hype, even if there are still places where I'm scratching my head. \\n The artwork itself is hit and miss, with Stephanie Hans's JiM #645 being the sole standout work.

Other than snarkier voices for all the main characters, there's not much fresh to take away from them, \\n But the Colleen Coover back-up features are a delight.

I\\'ll probably try the next volume in the series to see if it improves a bit.', 'This one is really good', 'Another atrocious entry in the Black Panther saga from David Liss, one of the worst comic book writers I\\'ve ever come across. As I said in my review of the previous volume, it feels like reading something written by a child or an adult who had a concussion and is just now regaining the ability to form words on the page. Every sentence uttered by every character is a complete waste of time, and the plots of these storylines could not be more on the nose if they were a nostril. \\n For instance, the main Fear Itself storyline (I guess) contained here features a villain called the Hatemonger, who is basically wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit. The character who becomes the Hatemonger, who we are introduced to over about 5 pages, is so overtly racist in every single sentence that he speaks that I just simply could not believe a person like this could exist. I mean, even the hardest of hardcore racists take a break to talk about NASCAR. \\n On top of this, the racism this guy spews forth isn\\'t even a real kind of racism. It\\'s like David Liss heard about racism and then just guessed as to how it might present itself. It\\'s this dude who tells every single person he ever comes across how terrible \"foreigners\" and \"immigrants\" are. It\\'s so vague. \"We\\'ve got to get rid of all these immigrants!\" is an actual thing he tells a stranger. I mean, no. No one does that! Maybe a lunatic on the subway might scream it at a trash can, but nobody in real life speaks this way. \\n The plot of this storyline basically involves a ton of random citizens rallying around the Hatemonger and spreading anger and xenophobia wherever they go. The problem is, this doesn\\'t actually amount to any sort of commentary on racism. Hatemonger isn\\'t able to draw people\\'s fears or prejudices out or anything like that. He just implants completely new hatreds into their minds from whole cloth. Great. Solid satire. \\n So, throw in a bad guy named \"American Panther,\" who is just some corrupt cop in a Panther suit who the real Black Panther defeats with essentially no effort, and you\\'ve got one hell of an ill-defined story. Stuff just happens and gets instantly resolved. Not to mention the fact that this all takes place in New York during Fear Itself, in which the entire city is under attack by thousands of Nazi robots and Asgardian monsters, and yet everyone in Hell\\'s Kitchen seems to be 100% fine and unbothered by this. Their biggest problem is a guy in a Klan hat shutting down a diner. \\n There are 2 other stories in here, which are both even worse than this one. I genuinely could not even understand the final story, which is a Spider Island crossover. Some dude in a car is driving around and narrating everything he does while Black Panther tries to stop him? I was completely lost. I will say this, though, the character of the car guy certainly seems to have been written by a 1000 year old man who\\'s trying to understand modern culture! Liss has the character keep using phrases like \"Check my Twitter\" and \"Update my Facebook page\" as if that is how we youngsters think all the time. \\n There are so many other things I could say about this piece of garbage book, but I\\'m done. I would laugh at how utterly terrible this book is, but its existence means other writers were denied the chance to write a comic in favor of this guy.

I watch these play-throughs as if they were show because they are episodic and it works like a show. Anyways, I watched the entire game and I was enthralled by the concept of fairy tale characters coming to our world, but unlike Once Upon a Time, these characters know who they were and where they came from. Eventually (2 years later), I finally decided to read the comics. \\n If Once Upon a Time and Bones / any detective show had a baby, this would be it. Because of this, I do find the story much darker compared to other things that have a similar concept of bringing fairytale characters to our world or changing their world. However, this is precisely what I liked about this spin on fairytales. Usually, these type of spins are aimed at younger audiences, and I\\'m sorry but I\\'m not 10 anymore, so this happens to be just perfect for me. \\n I liked the world building, I definitely want to find out more about how they ended up in New York City, and how their lives were in their homelands. I especially liked this whole concept of having to hide their identity from \"mundies\" using glamours, and how depending on what type of species they were they have a place to go in our world. The story also lends to comedic moments due to everyone\\'s pasts, which is always a pleasant reminder of the stories you heard as a kid. \\n My favorite aspect of the story is how different some of the characters are from their original stories. For example, I love how big of a douche Prince Charming is because it\\'s so far away from his typical portrayal in fairytale inspired stories. He\\'s usually either, charming and beautiful with a heart of gold or, so narcissistic that he spends all his time looking at himself in the mirror. Meanwhile, Bigby Wolf, literally The Big Bad Wolf, is now a caring (albeit aggressive) detective of the Fable community. \\n The reason why I didn\\'t give it a whole 5 stars, or even 4, is because while I read it I wasn\\'t entirely enjoying it. Mainly, because I kept thinking that Red Rose\\'s murder was the start of something much bigger, and honestly I wasn\\'t ready to embark on such a long journey to figure out who her murderer is. Personally, I don\\'t like huge mysteries that take several books or seasons to uncover.

I think it\\'s because the pages aren\\'t glossy enough... maybe they should invest in glossy pretty paper. However, the art before each volume are all beautiful and very different to the rest of the art style in the book. \\n I will definitely read the next volume, and decide after that if I want to continue reading the rest. \\n P.S.

Williams III's epic story. \\n This is a particularly difficult series to review because you don't just read Promethea; you experience it. Moore's writing and Williams' art join together to create something magical that succeeds because of the medium, not in spite of it. Promethea is very ambitious, and there were occasional moments when I had no idea what was going on plot-wise. Fortunately, the emotional undercurrents and the gorgeous art were more than enough to keep me invested, and the stunning final chapter tied everything together in a way I never thought possible. \\n I suspect that each person will react differently to Promethea depending on their own experiences. This is true of all art I suppose, but it seems particularly relevant here. I loved it, and I can't wait to reread each volume and look for things I missed the first time around. The next time someone tells you comics are for kids and don't have any literary merit, smack them (because that's an ignorant thing to say) and then give them a copy of Promethea. That should straighten them out.\", 'One hates to give a book that is a collection of artist\\'s work such a low rating, but I came to this book expecting an entree into the world of manga, and came out with favorable opinions of only a very small portion of it. To the point where I would put down these sparsely filled pages to pick up the Henry James novel I\\'m reading, because it seemed occasionally like a chore to get through what is (essentially) a comic book. \\n But take it with a grain of salt: I spent some time last year with anime, watching my kids\\' favorite stuff, because up till then it was largely just weirdness to me. There were a few things I liked as a very young child, like \"Speed Racer\", and \"Jack and the Witch\", but back when we called it \"Japanimation\", the visions of the original artists were poorly respected indeed, and hardly representative. Then in the \\'90s, some things showed up on cable that were, I think, more respective and more entertaining. The stuff that my kids recommended, like \"Full Metal Alchemist\" and \"Soul Eater\" were entertaining and sometimes moving. And I managed to get them hooked on \"The Devil is a Part Timer\". \\n But I like books and even comic books (though I\\'ve read few since my pre-teen years) and figured, well, if there\\'s good stuff out there, maybe won\\'t be as inaccessible as I fear. And maybe a lack of accessibility was part of the problem here. I had trouble parsing some of the images in some of the stories, for example. None of the story lines were particularly challenging however. \\n So, in 500+ pages, I found that I liked the 3 or 4 one-page kawaii cartoons about a cute bunny and an irascible hedgehog. Then not much else until \"New Shoes\", which I favored as it had no text and told its story very well. (There\\'s an alternate-universe fantasy story earlier in the book that I found artistically cluttered, hard to parse, and burdened with walls of words.) Andi Watson\\'s \"Princess at Midnight\" was charming enough to where I purchased the whole compilation (though from what I can glean, Ms. Watson may not have had to rush the ending). \\n The stories seem to get better after \"New Shoes\", but that starts on page 359. I thought the last story, \"The House That Wasn\\'t Her\", was interesting. And there\\'s an artist who has one story at the front of the book, and one at the back, Selina Dean, both of which I\\'m comfortable saying I didn\\'t \"get\". I didn\\'t hate them; I liked her art style enough. But I didn\\'t get the point of them. \\n Anyway, I bought a lot of three books of this, to discover that there only were three, and the scant reviews I can find are wildly enthusiastic.

The plot is starting to come together, and the end game is being slowly exposed. It is a lot less confusing than volume one, haha. This volume is also quite dark, darker than the last volume.

He is quite young, but a powerful Lotis master. I'm looking forward to seeing his character develop in the last three books. As for Kazuki, we haven't seen that much of him yet, but I feel like he'll have an important role to play. \\n Kyo and Alice continue to dance around each other, though I think Kyo is becoming much more aware of his own feelings. It's a shame that poor Alice can't do anything about it, though. :( Hopefully that'll get sorted out. \\n Frey had some character development too, even though it consisted mainly of him being a bit of a butt. It's nice to know that his personality doesn't just consist of being a bit of comic relief. He is still one of my favourite characters, though. \\n This one ended on a rather horrible cliffhanger.

It almost makes me want to continue reading Venom but I just know it won't be as good...is it? \\n So this volume is the second half of Rick's awesome run of a character you never would normally care about. The first few issues are kind of the over the top cartoony stuff I didn't love. It's Venom teaming up with a few other somewhat heroes like Ghost Rider and fight against some evil demon thingy. I dunno. These issues I kind of just breezed past because I didn't care for it. Once we get to Flash by himself it starts to show why this series is so good. Venom is dealing with the fallout of his father's death from the first volume plus dealing with Betty and then the Savage Six (think sinister six but after venom) come after his family and shit really starts to build up. By the end Venom finishes his mission and you feel it come full circle. \\n Good: The internal thoughts of Flash really keep this series high. I love hearing his thoughts and mindset with all this crazy shit going on. The fights are epic and sometimes really brutal. This ain't spider-man kids! Also the pacing once the first few issues are out of the way are amazing and really ends on a high note. \\n Bad: The first few issues are goofy and not a good jump on point. I mean you should read volume 1 first anyway, but the crossover event is something I could have lived without to be honest. \\n Overall I enjoyed the fuck out of this just like volume 1.

Considering the volumes were only arbitrary breaks in an otherwise continuous storyline, I chose to only review that initial volume. The quality was consistent throughout, so I issued the same 4 stars to all but the finale, which, in my view, was bit underwhelming. Due to said finale, and hindsight being 20-20 and whatnot, I believe those 4 stars for the rest of the volumes were a tad bit generous. Let me try to explain why. \\n The premise was intriguing, \"23 years ago, twelve strange children were born in England at exactly the same time.6 years ago, the world ended.This is the story of what happened next.\" But it never developed into the epic story I had envisioned. The FreakAngels spent more time bickering among themselves, than focusing on the bigger picture. Each assumed a fairly stereotypical role. Some helpful--mechanic, engineer, doctor, salvager hunter, watch tower guard, gardener, group historian; some harmful--sexual criminal, mind controlling outcast; some somewhere in between--free love enthusiast, free spirit wackadoodle. And then there was my personal favorite, Kaitlyn, AKA Whitechapel police. \\n Who had her very own torture chamber holding cell! \\n Not only did the FreakAngels fall into these generic roles, but half of the group wound up falling in lurve with one another, which led to some added drama. Most of the group\\'s energy though was aimed at puzzling out the outcast\\'s nefarious plans, putting the pervert on lock down, and preventing either from wrecking any more havoc on the innocent civilians caught in the fallout. \\n The art had a workmanlike quality to it. It was serviceable, but not all that creative or original. There was a basic, straightforward layout with muted colors. Some of the faces looked weird, when laughing or shouting, and it oddly appeared as though the doctor lady was sporting a pencil mustache in various panels. There was nothing really poster worthy here, in my opinion. Although, things did improve somewhat in volume 5, by adding some vibrant colors to the mix. That\\'s also where the storyline began to come together. \\n On a positive note, the FreakAngels\\' powers were pretty awesome, and it was clever how things steadily escalated over time. I thought that part of the story was brilliantly executed. \\n And, the storyline itself was fairly consistent from volume to volume, unlike a few other series I\\'ve read. *cough* Saga *cough* The group dynamics were well reasoned, and I enjoyed most all of the characters. There were some great moments of levity throughout, most often provided by Kaitlyn, whom I found to be very amusing. \\n Bottom line: Although I\\'m adjusting my ratings down to 3.5 stars for volumes 1-4, I\\'ll stick with 4 stars for Vol. 5, due to the uptick in the artwork, and then 3 stars for Vol. 6. Overall, I would still recommend the series, but it wasn\\'t as epically awesome as some of the other graphic novels I\\'ve read, such as Locke & Key. \\n If you\\'re looking for a post-apocalyptic story, FreakAngels is definitely one worth considering.

Oddly enough, a lot DIFFERENT than the series, not just in what happens, but also what themes are explored and what ideas are presented. There's a really cool moment in the graphic novel where the reader has to ask if the title The Walking Dead, is a reference to the zombies, or to the main characters, who- although alive- are just getting by, knowing they'll eventually die. There's a lot of human/zombie comparisons that are really interesting that you don't get in the show. The show is more exciting, action packed. I probably prefer the show. \\n This was my first time reading a graphic novel - really interesting medium for storytelling. Unlike a book, there's no narration, no description.

Even Brubaker at his \"worst\" with Cap is still a ton of fun, and well worth the read. \\n I also really appreciate his attempt to bring the Winter Soldier storyline full circle in this volume.

You kill a character....later you could bring him back. DC has done it with other characters and also with Batman at the end of their event, Final Crisis. And Marvel of course, has their own share of resurrections as well. \\n In this case, its Steve Rogers or better known as Captain America. I missed out on the issue where they killed him but at least a little flashback is included here for those who missed it. :) \\n Apparently he wasn\\'t really dead and that his \"death\" was a ploy by the Red Skull and Doctor Doom. Skull, who is now a disembodied entitity inhabiting a robotic version of himself, had planned to come back in human form by hijacking the body of Steve Rogers and later animating it with him in it in order to infiltrate the Avengers themselves and undermine the Us govt and eventually take over.

Friends Jo, April, Mal, Molly and Ripley stick together like PB&J and have some exciting - and dangerous - adventures at this Camp for Hardcore Lady Types. There\\'s a mix of backwoods country, rockabilly and urban teen all mixed into the characters. The girls stumble upon some really strange things around camp, and as the summer goes on and strange things continue happening, they are set on solving the mysteries. They encounter all manner of craziness and creatures along the way, so they stick to their core camp concepts: stranger danger and friendship to the max. \\n The Players \\n Jo - a tall Davy Crocket type who seems to like Mal \\n April - the fierce yet kind redhead of the group, she is an odd mix of Disney princess and warrior \\n Mal - a punkrock hipster kind of girl who seems to kind of like Jo \\n Molly - a tall Lumberjack type who knows all things Lumberjanes, she is also very sarcastic and smart alecky \\n Ripley - cares strongly about things like kittens and cake, easily distracted, appears to be the youngest of the group \\n Jen - the camp counselor for the girls, she is very good at loosing the girls and gets very flustered \\n Rosie - the director of the Camp for Hardcore Lady Types \\n The Quote \\n So we were in our bunks just like we were supposed to be, right? And we heard a rumble and a whoosh, and then we saw - well, Jo and I saw - the super weird old lady outside the cabin. \\n So I went down into April\\'s bunk because of , y\\'know, stranger danger. \\n - SHE WAS LIKE SUPER WEIRD, LIKE THIS - \\n And THEN the woman said a lot of swears I\\'d never heard before and then WOOOOSH and AHH BRIGHT LIGHTS and then there was a BEAR! \\n So Jo and I woke up all of our friends because \"FRIENDSHIP TO THE MAX,\" obviously, and we went after it and then there were foxes and here we are. \\n The Highs and Lows \\n / Plot. The plot had its good and bad points. There wasn\\'t much of a real plot there, just a jumble of various adventures. The chapters center around an adventure to get a particular Lumberjane badge, but the events themselves are kind of all over the place. Even the dialogue between characters was a bit off at times, like the characters were on in some inside joke and readers were left with no clue. There was the whole Kitten Holy thing in the first chapter, which also came back full circle in the end and they found out what it meant, but otherwise there was no significant plot development. \\n + Ripley. If I could have been anyone in this crazy adventure of the Camp for Hardcore Lady Types, I would want to be Ripley. She goes with the flow and doesn\\'t get caught up in the details. Kittens and cake and unicorns and puppies all the way! \\n + The Art. The artwork and illustration are terrific! I wish my life could be designed and illustrated like this. \\n + Jen. She is the classic worrywart, and it is clear she loves her group of girls - crazy adventures and elevated blood pressure and all. \\n - Rosie. There were a few moments that Rosie seemed...odd. I can\\'t quite put my finger on how to describe it, but I don\\'t trust her. But she definitely and clearly is meant to be a reincarnation of Rosie the Riveter...with a sophisticated Daphne look. \\n / Humor. The authors and illustrator clearly spent time developing the Lumberjanes and the humor of the dialogue and the drawings had me giggling while I flipped the glossy pages. Sometimes I got the impression the authors were trying to hard to push a lot of references. I have a movie and music buff in the friend circle, and even I was lost on some of the references. Like make up tutorials, less is more. Sometimes it was a little overdone. However, when the humor was on, it was on. \\n The Take-Away \\n I liked the focus on certain characters throughout the entire volume. Each character had a little spotlight and readers had the opportunity to get insight into them as individuals, but also in pairs. \\n Recommendation - Buy, Borrow or Skip? \\n Borrow. If I continue reading the series, I doubt I\\'ll continue to buy the physical books. I will try to borrow from libraries or friends to keep reading the series.

Great Peter Parker moment contained within...', \"This book collects 31 comic books related to the first Spider-Woman Jessica Drew from the late 1970s including her debut in Marvel Spotlight #32, and her crossover in Marvel Two in One #29-33 and the first twenty-five issues of her own magazine. \\n There's a lot to like about the character and the magazine. She's a woman who has reached adulthood without a past. When she first appears, she's an assassin for HYDRA sent to kill Nick Fury but she realizes she's been brainwashed and turns against evil Hydra only to be recaptured and attack the Thing and then help him in the five part Arch from Marvel Two in One. Then in her own magazines, she fights all kinds of evils. \\n There's a lot to like about this Spider-woman. The first 19 issues of her magazine are pencilled by the great Carmine Infantino, best known for his work on the Flash. Superhero comics are notorious to shoving women into the most bizarre costumes and poses but Spider-woman may be the best designed superheroine with a costume that's classy, well-designed, and functional. \\n The character also has a mix of courage and curiosity, but also a great deal of naivete which makes for an interesting character. Plus she has a serious problem that gives people (other women in particular) a serious dislike for her which makes finding a job problematic. \\n The big downside of the book is that they really don't seem to know what they want her to be. The original slant would have indicated a lot of SHIELD like Spy capers and indeed one issue in her series did have her help her boyfriend Jerry stop a terrorist attack. But mostly she faded into horror comic-like stuff. There was nothing magical about her powers though perhaps they thought the color scheme would indicate horror, but whatever the case in her first 19 issues she had two encounters with Werewolf by Night, several with the Brothers Grimm, Morgana LeFaye among others. These were mostly D-list Marvel characters. Nothing incredibly stupid happened in these stories, the book just seemed to drift. \\n The only truly dumb thing was her relationship with Jerry which began instantaneously for no reason and ended because she kept saving Jerry. Thankfully by the 1970s, Marvel was no longer making us suffer through break ups that lasted a year, but the entire thing was pointless. \\n Spider-woman went through three writers after Archie Goodwin wrote the origin story, Marv Wolfman wrote the story arch from Marvel Two in One and then the first eight issues of the comic, Mark Grunewald took over for issues 9-20 and 21-25 by Mark Fleischer. \\n Issue 20 brought the inevitable meeting between Spider-man and Spider-woman which was a fun little jaunt that included her thinking Spider-man had ripped off her identity. It was nice to see Spider-man guest star in a book without being a jerk. Fleischer took the book in a new direction for the last five issues establishing Spider-girl as a bounty hunting crimefighter. I have mixed feelings on her falling in loved with the Gamesman, the first big time crook she snags, but I was satisfied with the conclusion. \\n Overall, this is an okay book. I give it 3 stars but I consider it to be towards the higher end of that rating. There's not a whole lot bad about the book, but there's nothing amazing, spectacular, or sensational about it either. It's solidly written in most parts with a few above average stories thrown in.\", '3.5', 'This keeps getting better every volume.', 'Cool series. This is one of the best in it!', 'Soft, sweet and generally rather adorable', 'God damn this series is good...', 'I gobbled this one down, then re-read it, re-read the whole series.

In a lot of ways, this graphic novel version of John Lewis' story makes it easier to read than a normal memoir. In other ways, however, seeing some of the brutality, discrimination, and violence through pictures not just words makes it more difficult to read. I had a hard time looking at the illustrations of some of the beatings and murders, some of which I already knew about and others I certainly didn't. \\n It's hard for me to put into words what I thought about this book, because all the thoughts I had while reading were mixed up in my mind with how I felt about what was taking place in the book as well as what's happening right now in the country. Yesterday was the women's march in Washington following the inauguration of Donald Trump, which took place a week after Donald Trump insulted John Lewis on Twitter. Past and present are not two separate things for me right now. It's all mixed together in my head along with the desire for all people to be free and equal and prosperous in America. \\n This volume shows John Lewis' history with nonviolence protests in the years leading up to and including the March on Washington. It also points out a lot of key figures and shows the cultural climate in a number of different regions of the country, including the deep south. There were a lot of moments when I was anxious and appalled. But when his group of freedom riders were dropped off by the police in Klan country, I was terrified for their safety. I really liked that the focus was all over the place and included people like Malcolm X, even though he wasn't in the nonviolent resistance movement, because it was all part of what was going on and different approaches groups were taking. But I especially liked how true to his convictions John was throughout. Any one of the instances mentioned in the book would be enough to give someone reason to doubt or retreat. But freedom comes at a price and comes from a show of strength. And it turns out that his actions helped not only mold the movement but also bring about real change. He inspired people to believe in themselves. He inspired people to fight not just for what the government wants to get you but what you deserve. Seeing his conviction in wanting every person of age be able to vote in our country was moving. And seeing Robert Kennedy come to understand and change because of what he was seeing was beautiful. I feel like I want to memorize the SNCC document shown in the book; some excellent quotes in there. \\n And, of course, the March on Washington was beautifully done. I really enjoyed getting to learn a little about Bayard Rustin and see him in action here, even though he was a controversial choice to organize the march at the time. And one certainly can't miss the parallel the author and artist made between that crowd in Washington and the one assembled for President Obama's inauguration. I was particularly moved to see the kindness and respect of John Lewis' fellow Senators as they took their places to assemble for the inauguration and the way Obama greeted him. I remember watching that moment on television and being moved then, but seeing it from John Lewis' perspective here was even more powerful. \\n I also loved that John Lewis' original speech from the march on Washington was included at the end of the book; I read it through twice.\", \"I enjoyed Round Two much better than Round One. Where Round One was more about action and setting the whole Copra world up, Round Two took the time to tell us more about the characters.

There's something rather visceral about the character that draws you in, something greater than the character itself. I can't really say what, but all I can say is that of all the Star Trek villains over the decades, he is definitely one of my favourites. \\n Recently, IDW Publishing announced plans to publish a new ongoing series for their Star Trek franchise and that this would focus on Khan as he was presented in the recent Star Trek: Into Darkness movie, the sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Star Trek. These movies are a reboot of the old The Original Series sub-franchise and they redefine a lot of the lore that has been canon over the years. Khan himself is no stranger to a change in lore since the Greg Cox trilogy is considered to be out of official Star Trek canon as well. And the new series introduces a brand-new canon, if this first issue is anything to by. \\n ST2-Khan01-coverThis issue begins in the wake of the ending of Star Trek: Into Darkness, with Khan being brought in before a full Federation council for a trial. He is charged with wholesale murder of Federation civilians and hence his trial is a Federation matter rather than a specific Starfleet one. After some initial hostility towards his accusers, Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock, Khan begins to narrate the tale of who he is. He tells of who he was before Admiral Marcus found his hibernation pods, and those of his fellow superhumans. \\n Going entirely on the basis of this issue only, and ignoring any previous in-continuity material (since the new movies are creating their own continuity and this comic is a part of that), this is a fairly decent issue. I'm previously familiar with Mike Johnson through his work on the first year of Supergirl in the New 52 and its nice to see him doing something else these days. I haven't exactly kept up with his work, so he could very well have been busy since he stepped off Supergirl, but still, his scripts were decent material. And that's what this new comic is as well. Its a decent enough story that could be better, but it does tell an interesting tale of how Khan came to be. Or rather, how Noonien Singh became who he is, the early days of his metamorphosis into a superhuman. \\n One of the things I liked about this comic is that in a very short and sweet sequence the point is made that the Benedict Cumberbatch Khan looks absolutely nothing like the Ricardo Montalban Khan. The original Khan was flawed in terms of casting because a non-Indian actor was playing a fully Indian character, and this error was magnified by the new movie which had a pretty much full-white cast. So its nice to see that some effort is being made to explain the changes, albeit lore-wise. \\n The story itself is fairly predictable, especially if you have familiarity with the Greg Cox novels to a degree since they too focused on how Khan came to be. However, predictable in this specific case doesn't mean boring. The story flows pretty smoothly from page to page and the enjoyment factor is from the execution rather than the beginning and the end. Knowing that Khan is a super-genius in addition to being physically superior to regular humans, it is still entertaining to see how he flips the tables on those who created him, and through the dialogue of Dr. Heisen, we get a nice glimpse into Khan's early childhood and his development. It also establishes the groundwork for the Khan-to-be. \\n There is an interesting division of the artwork in this issue. David Messini does the pencils and inks for the present story while Claudia Balboni does the pencils for the (main) flashback story with Marina Castelvetro doing the corresponding inks. And Claudia ScarletGothica does the colours for the issue, while Neil Uyetake does the letters. The art, throughout, is very dynamic and lively. For his part, David Messini does a pretty good job of staying true to the actors who portrayed the relevant characters in the movies. There are some slight differences in how they are drawn, so that the art is not an exact likeness but close enough. The characters are instantly recognizable and that's the main thing. Claudia Balboni has much more freedom of course and she uses that to the utmost. The art is generally minimalist, and lacks any particular flourish, but it is good, clean artwork regardless. And as far as the colours are concerned, they were the same. The lighting effects used were a nice touch, although the issue was a bit too bright for my tastes. And given that the movie this is based on is called Into Darkness, there's a slight disconnect. \\n Overall though, this was a fun issue, and I'm looking forward to reading the second next month. Its going to be interesting to see how the lore is changed/rebooted/affected. \\n Rating: 8/10\", 'Now I have to wait for volume 4.', 'I wanted to read this after viewing some of the lovely artwork on Tumblr, and I was not disappointed.

A teacher of Michael's saw that he was very depressed and suggested that talking to other students about his ordeal might help him.

A little restraint might be a good way to start, though that seems a touch unlikely.\", 'Aunque de la legendaria pareja de caricaturista mexicano formaba por Jis y Trino el primero sea considerado el mas \"propositivo\" (tanto en terminos de su estilo visual, como de los temas tratados en sus caricaturas), Trino es el mas dotado para la historieta pura, lo cual no quiere decir necesariamente que sea un producto simplon, sino que es capaz de manejar con maestria el formato de los tres \"cuadritos\" para hacer reir a su publico. Y, al menos en lo que Mexico respecta, un poco de sentido del humor es ampliamente bienvenido. En \"Historias del fin del mundo\", Trino hace mofa de las actitudes alarmistas ante las \"profecias\" sobre el fin del mundo, avivadas por el supuesto fin del calendario maya, aunque tampoco se salvan Nostradamus y sus colegas. Mas alla de lo que uno espere para el 12 de diciembre de 2012, los monos de Trino nos permiten reir de las supersticiones humanas y de las actitudes irracionales que salen a flote en situaciones extremas y observamos como siempre hay alguien dispuesto a aprovechar la ingenuidad de otros. Una lectura amena, ligera (en el buen sentido) es lo que espera a quienes abran las paginas de esta recopilacion de tiras apocalipticas de Trino.', \"Given how many times I've read Sandman, it's a little silly I never read this before, but I really enjoyed it. It's easy to read, and offers a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes information about the series. I wouldn't recommend reading it if you've never read the series, but it's great for people who are already fans.\", \"A lot of groaning and yelling about how ridiculous and fantastical the plot is. I can't stop laughing at how stupid this is. Maybe that's the point of a parody. Characterizations were spot on thought.

Looking forward to the next one.', 'This has got to be the most artistically creative book I have ever read. The author tells four distinct stories using 14 pieces. What do I mean by pieces? Well, there are bound books, pamphlets, accordion books, huge newspaper style parts, etc. It all comes neatly packaged in this wonderful box. \\n So how to even read it? After drooling over the box art, you slowly lift the lid, take everything out of the box, ogle at all the pieces, and then randomly pick one to start reading. There is no order as to how you read this book, and that is part of the magic. Everyone will read it differently, so how the characters and events unfold will be different for each reader. The four main stories all intersect at various points in time - present, past, future. But what might have happened in my future timeline, might be your present one. How cool is that? \\n When you get the book, I recommend sitting on the floor so you can spread it all around you. Then take a deep breath and dive into this marvelous world.', \"I think all the reviews that I've read for this volume all agree on one thing: yay for Ryo! She finally gets her share of the Otomen spotlight that have avoided her all this time. \\n Ryo takes over coaching an all-boys judo team after she accidentally breaks the arm of the team's captain. In typical shoujo form, she dresses up as a boy since the school forbids girls to even step on the hallowed school grounds. \\n It has been so rare to see Ryo's point of view in this series. Most of them, the reader gets insight on Asuka's anxieties and insecurities. I really felt that Ryo was portrayed without the usual teenage angst, so seeing that she does have the same worries as Asuka makes her a more complex and sympathetic character. \\n It's funny how Ryo's father asks her if she and Asuka have clashed head on; little did she expect how literally they would've clashed in the judo arena. I sort of wished they did battle one-on-one. \\n I was starting to get bored of the series prior to volume since the stories seemed to be slight variations on the theme of the various otomen trying to be accepted for who they are. This volume has made me excited about this series again, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where Asuka, Ryo, and the rest of the group will go in the future.\", 'Was a cute read.', \"This is the third graphic novel about Cici, a young girl who also happens to be a fairy. Her Abuela, who is also a fairy, is trying to teach her about her powers and skills she has and will obtain as a fairy. When her father takes her, her sister and best friend on their annual camping trip, Cici has everything planned. Unfortunately, things do not work out as planned. It rains, their campsite is not reserved so they are not near the lake, they get lost on a hike and they can't swim because there are no lifeguards. When she meets a creature in the woods who wants to be her friend, she is annoyed and afraid. She does not give him a chance to show her that surprises and unexpected happenings can be good. She eventually realizes that everyone else is having a good time and that she needs to lighten up and enjoy herself. When she tells Abuela what happened, she learns that it was a Wood Sprite that she met and that he was just trying to teach her to enjoy surprises and be open to the world around her. The graphics are fun, colourful and easy to see detail, perfect for younger readers. \\n This is a great book for early readers (gr. 2 - 4), especially girls. A good addition to a school or classroom library. The publisher generously provided me with a copy of this book via Netgalley.\", \"I just got back from Guatemala very early Sunday morning. It has taken awhile to get back into the swing of things. I had good intentions of reading while I was there and I did read a few books but I feel a bit behind. I received this book yesterday and it had two things going for it right off - it's about Baba Yaga - how fun and it is a graphic novel so it was fairly quick. Just to make you all jealous - I read it in my kayak on the pond. \\n So I am not always a fan of graphic novels but I loved this. Masha's mom died when she was young and her beloved grandmother has also died. Her father is getting remarried to a women who Masha has never met and who has a daughter named Danielle. Masha decides to apply to be Baba Yaga's assistant. She has grown up hearing the tales about Baba Yaga, including her grandmother's own stories. I loved how clever Masha was and how she passed the tests and rescued some children.

And the artwork is fun enough that I only need a small bit of narration to help move the story along anyways. \\n But I'll tell ya what - every time I picked up a new issue of this I had the damnedest time trying to remember what had happened beforehand. \\n Soooo...there's that. \\n And now they are taking a 3-month break, or something?

Sadly (for her, not the reader who gets to gawk at several nude illustrations) Carol shacks anyone with a male anatomy.

Once again, Rumiko Takahashi\\'s \"Rin-Ne\" series continues to add on more characters in this series while also building up the world that the characters live in and I have to say that this series just keeps on getting more interesting as the story goes on! \\n In this volume, the first story continues from where the story in the last volume left off with Ageha being swallowed up by a giant mongoose spirit when she and Oboro get into a huge fight as Oboro tries to get out of being Ageha\\'s black cat by contract. So, Rinne has to try to rescue Ageha while trying to patch things up between Ageha and her black cat by contract. Other stories in this volume include Rinne and Sakura meeting a ghost stuck on a train, meeting Kain\\'s black cat by contract Suzu after a huge misunderstanding, and taking care of a ghost who is haunting the house of one of Sakura\\'s friends. \\n Join in more fun adventures of this fantastic series! \\n Rumiko Takahashi continues to make this series fun to read as we get to see more adventures from Rinne and his friends and continuing seeing some world building as this series goes on. I was really interested in the storyline involving Ageha and Oboro since before that point, the only character who had a black cat by contract was Rinne, so it was interesting seeing Ageha actually have a black cat by contract of her own and see how her relationship with Oboro is much different and more tense than Rinne\\'s relationship with Rokumon. I also enjoyed the fact that we continue to see Rinne develop relationships with other characters such as Kain and Suzu as it would make some pretty interesting storylines between them in the near future. Rumiko Takahashi\\'s artwork is as usual cute and creative to look at as the images of the black cats are pretty adorable and some of the spirits that Rinne and Sakura encounter are creative to look at as they vary in appearances and shapes. \\n A bit of warning for anyone about to read this volume: there is a bit of crude humor in this volume as characters are constantly beating each other up, even though that has been around since the beginning of this series and is also a staple of Rumiko Takahashi\\'s works. Anyone who does not like that type of humor might want to read this volume with caution. \\n Overall, \"Rin-Ne Volume Ten\" is a great volume to read if you are a huge fan of the \"Rin-Ne\" series! Even though, I wish that we actually have a volume that has continuity for this series, I am still enjoying these short stories that we are getting at the moment. \\n Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog', \"This volume starts off with Chapter 181: The Fight Begins...! \\n This volume is what sealed the deal fo me to forevermore hate Uchiha, Sasuke.

Of course his improvement won't seem as drastic as Naruto's because he was at the bottom of the totem poll so to say. No one ever took the time or overcame their prejudice to actually teach the boy anything, when Sasuke takes everything for granted when he was effing spoon fed jutsu from anyone because they felt sorry for him. \\n Sakura meets him at the only exit to the village, and begs him to reconsider or take her with him.

It's an Inca curse, apparently, though since this volume is only part one of the story, how/why it works remains opaque. There DOES seem to be something supernatural going on (that cover image is a literal scene from the book), but there's also a mysterious Incan descendant runing around (not to mention Colonel Alcazar, who seems to serve no useful plot function), so we have to wait until the next volume--Prisoners of the Sun (which I've read already)--to find out. I confess that, much as I like Tintin, I find these two-book adventures a bit irritating. The first volumes never satisfy, really, especially because I find myself chafing at the space devoted to slapstick gags (at least one every two or three pages) rather than to plot advancement. These can be funny, but they do tend to get tedious after a while. How many times can Captain Haddock get himself into some silly physical predicament, after all? Would it kill them just to do a 120 page album and get it all in one book? Plotting seems desultory. The Thomson/Thompson twins just turn up to consult with Tintin for no apparent reason, for instance. Anyway, we have the characteristically clear and meticulous art to admire.

I simply couldn't stop. \\n Bayou tells the tell of a Lee, a young black girl living in 1930s Mississippi, with her sharecropper father. Her friend, a young white girl named Lily, loses her necklace while her and Lee are playing down by the bayou, and tells her mom that it was Lee that stole it. \\n To make matters worse, shortly after that fiasco, Lily goes missing, and Lee's father gets (wrongly) blamed for it (pretty much the worst thing a black man could do in the rural south of the 30s). \\n What follows is a journey that Lee takes to seek justice for her father, but it's not simple by any means. There's a whole other world down around the Bayou that Lee becomes a part of, filled with characters like the gentle giant Bayou, a sick and twisted Reverend Bear, as well as good ol' Br'er Rabbit. \\n Aside from the haunting story, the illustrations are just wonderful. Each turn of the (virtual, in my case) page was one delight after another. \\n Be warned, this story ends abruptly, much to my dismay and almost anger; but then I realized: this is just the first volume.\", 'Wow!', \"4.5. The drawing and coloring is stellar, and the characters are quirky with distinct personalities, though some of them get a little close to yaoi cliches: pink-haired uke, GFY, etc. I don't mind though because it seems this is just meant to be for fun. There's not much plot outside the relationships between the characters, but those are complez and often go in unexpected directions. On a personal note, if I want to read a yaoi manga, I could do without the explicit het scenes they sometimes throw in. If they'd fade those to black, I'd give it a five.\", 'Will read original but this is a great telling of the story.', \"This was fun.

If you haven't been reading it yet then - well - you should go on and read the previous three volumes, savoring them slowly, before reading volume three because this is not a manga you can jump in the middle with both feet and expect to enjoy it to the upmost levels possible. So fellow readers can understand when I say that the fourth volume is, for lack of better words, rather monumental. \\n What's so major about this volume of Children of the Sea? There is plot development - and tons of it. And with all of the development, we get insight into more and more mysteries. For one thing, we get to look deep into the pasts of both Kanako and Anglade, giving their characters some much needed expansion. Granted, Anglade is still a bit of a mystery - and very mysterious in nature - but I'm glad for the look at Kanako's youth and the circumstances that led to Ruka's birth. She's turned from a slightly developed character to one that is well-rounded and terribly interesting; I'm looking forward to more of the chapters with Kanako and Dehdeh. Their trip across the sea in search of Ruka and Umi is immensely fascinating, as is Ruka's descent into the ocean with the meteorite in her body - although who knows how long that odd relationship between human and stone will last, if the volume's cliffhanger ending is anything to go by. \\n Fish are disappearing, the ocean is becoming more active than ever, the creatures of the water are continuing to attract attention from not only the marine biologists but also the world at large - and in the middle of everything are Ruka and Umi and Sora, the children of the sea. There's drama and action and mystery and beautiful art and everything you could ever ask of a seinen manga. You want a deeply underappreciated series that deserves all the critical acclaim it garners from day one? You want Children of the Sea - and if the latest volume is anything to go by, Daisuke Igarashi is doing his best to make it a modern-day manga classic.\", \"Better than volume 1, but still not great \\n Yet again I find myself struggling with a rating on this. So far in this series, Azzarello will give me something I like and then I start feeling excited and then the next page there will be something that annoys the hell out of me and I'm right back to feeling ambivalent. And this time they're totally different annoying things! \\n I will say that so far the best thing about this series is how well written Wonder Woman is as a character. The side characters I honestly still don't care about all that much but Azzarello does a fantastic job making Wonder Woman feel like a genuinely strong female protagonist. In this volume, Wonder Woman descends into Hell to save Zola and ends up with more than she bargained for. In this situation, you almost expect someone to have to save her. But Wonder Woman doesn't need any of that shit, she's one of those self-rescuing princesses. YAAAAAAY!!!! Seriously, I cannot express how much I love Azzarello for that. He strikes a perfect balance between making her strong-willed and badass and yet not a cold, unfeeling bitch. I can find absolutely no fault whatsoever in how she's portrayed. \\n Even better, the story FINALLY starts getting interesting, particularly towards the end of this volume. I like this new gods vs old gods dynamic and the way in which Zola's child is being drawn into it. I'm curious to see where these relationship shifts are going to take Wonder Woman in the future volumes. \\n BUT...sweet Jesus the tone of the entire thing is SO melodramatic. I mean, I guess it's a grand Greek hero story so I should probably expect some of that but there were multiple times that had me rolling my eyes. Maybe it's just Azzarello's style, I really don't know. Can't say I've read much by him. Anything, actually. Either way, I'm not a fan. It just sucks to have this interesting story, a fantastic female lead and then...just silly writing. It pulls me out of the story and annoys the hell out of me. \\n Are you fucking kidding me, Azzarello?! That's how we're gonna end this little jaunt to hell?! I'm not sure you could get more trite if you tried. \\n My irritation with the melodrama aside, this is MUCH better than the previous volume. Overall, it's a good Wonder Woman story and the series has the potential for much more so I'm slowly starting to warm up to it.\", \"Tintin is becoming more and more the detective (though he's pretty terrible at his actual profession: journalist). This has been my favorite Tintin yarn thus far, as it has a lot more action and adventure. It still has a fair amount of deus ex machina and coincidence, but it doesn't feel as intrusive as in previous volumes. Perhaps I'm just getting used to it. My favorite part has to be the fact that Snowy's lines are significantly cut in this volume. I can only hope this trend continues.\", \"I was really excited to read the first volume in this new YA fantasy manga series. The story sounded amazing. I ended up being a bit disappointed, the whole book is okay but never really drew me in. \\n The idea behind the story itself is a fun one. However the whole explanation of the magic system in the beginning was very lecture-like and was an awkward info-dump that bogged down the flow of the story. \\n Additionally the dialogue between characters comes off as very simple and awkward. The whole story was fairly simple. I would have liked more explanation behind the four kingdoms and their magic up front, but maybe done in a story format rather than a lecture. \\n The illustration is simple but well done. It's very no-frills; I prefer a lot more detail in my mangas. The characters were easy to distinguish from one another but not very engaging. The story panels were easy to follow but, again, overly simple for me. \\n Overall this was okay but not great. I thought everything was too simple and plain; I was expecting something magical but ended up with a child-like story with awkward dialogue. The illustration was similar; decently done but with very little detail. I had high hopes for this series but ended up just wanting...more...from it.

Much of what happens has us expecting the return of Rasputin (featured in some of the earliest Hellboy stories), but could there be someone else just as bad (or worse) bent on a comeback? The action jumps around all over the globe, with a team of agents laying siege to a castle in Scotland and being attacked by mutant wildlife and the remains of dead giants from some ancient battle. Then there\\'s stuff happening at B.P.R.D. headquarters in the Rocky Mountains as an arrangement is reached with the Zinco Corporation to use its growth-enhancing drugs on a clone that might be used to house the spirit of Johan Krauss, stuck in a containment suit after his physical body was destroyed while his spirit was outside.

There\\'s so much happening, it\\'s sometimes hard to keep track of it all. The artwork, primarily by Tyler Crook, is very good and very much in keeping with other artists who\\'ve contributed so much to the series\\' look and feel. It all seems to be leading up to some big, apocalyptic event that sometimes has me wishing we were back in the days when the group was dealing with smaller threats. Still, I\\'m very interested in seeing where this is all going and will continue to go along for the ride. **ARC by NetGalley', \"Nanami and Kirihito work their way through the underworld and tangle with the kami in control down there. Nanami uses her power to trick her way into staying so she can rescue Kirihito (who she promised...though I really wish she didn't feel obligated cuz I think we'll all regret it later). Tomoe risks everything to be able to rescue her, returning to his full youkai form for the power but this causes him to be imprisoned by the upper Kami and he is not sure he wishes to return to being Nanami's shinshi. However, he discovers some things about himself and about this crazy human kami and things return to some form of normalcy. \\n However, a visit from a surprising source gives Nanami an idea of a larger plot going on...seems there is more to this story then first meets the eye! \\n NEED THE NEXT VOLUME!\", 'Favorite cover art so far', 'Entre mas leo cosas de este senor mas lo admiro.', 'Ahhhhh definitely a 3.5 but I may change that to 4 stars later? I will have to think about it.', \"An odd little collection which I mainly bought for the Avengers Assemble issues (I'd already read the Superior Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Wolverine & The X-Men, & The Uncanny Avengers issues). The two I bought it for were good, but the rest felt a little disjointed, especially the Fearless Defenders issue.\", 'This particular Batman graphic novel has a slightly brighter color pallet than what was used in Batman: The Court of Owls, Volume 1, which suits the bold and gorgeous penciling of David Finch. The Dark Knight series steps a bit outside of Gotham location wise, as well as drawing in help from various members of the Justice League. The pacing is much faster than the more classic detective vibe you can find in The Court of Owls, which can be both good, and bad as there are so many villains in this book that it gets a tad ridiculous. Still, this is an incredibly enjoyable graphic novel.', 'Liked this one too! Am looking forward to reading more Marvel comics.', '1. permohonan Momo (jadi orang dewasa) \\n 2. Sayonara Mamoru \\n 3.

And what you believe in.', 'Podem ler a opiniao completa AQUI. \\n A good companion for the books (a prequel actually), with great art and the usual Harry Dresden character (which I happen to find extremely amusing). \\n Also good for everyone who loves animals.', \"This was an interesting take on Wolverine. The author did a good job bringing out Logan's immortality, which many longtime readers such as myself may not have chosen to think about over the years. I mean, our super heroes live forever and don't age in the comics right? No spoilers, but it was a sad series.\", \"Probably my least favorite volume so far, rough to start, though it delivered in the end. I'd give it 3.5 if I could.\", \"This book is so heart wrenching. I love it because we get to enjoy the entrance of, my favorite, sailor Venus <3 <3 <3 <3 \\n Poor Usagi and Mamu-chan...their story is just constantly not going the way we want. Epicly star crossed lovers. \\n PS. I absolutely LOVE the translation notes at the end, I'm not sure if they had that in the original translations...I don't remember. Either way, love it!\", \"I had read the webcomic first chapter or so posted on the author's website. It was exciting and fun and I was very happy to receive the book for Christmas. I knew it would be quick to read, and it is. But it had a nice completeness. Not that I would reject a sequel. But it was a complete story for being so short. For all that it's Delilah Dirk's name on the cover, this is not her origin story. It's the origin story of the Turkish Lieutenant. How he goes from being a normal soldier with a love for tea into an adventuring hero, with a love for tea. It is fantastic and legendary, but also funny and infused with historical and realistic details. There were a couple parts where the story got a little confusing, or the art was hard to follow. But overall I enjoyed the story and the art.\", 'Actual rating: 3.5 stars', '\"I had been King only a few days. My anger knew no bounds.

I'm no graphic novel expert but Bechdel seems to use the medium extremely well, balancing the narrative with the imagery to great effect.\", \"This book really starts to develop their personalities - and I enjoyed the way Rocket especially was written. \\n But isn't this Angela from Image? After some research, I found out that Neil Gaiman (!) created Angela in the Spawn comics and after some legal wrangling got the full rights to her, and then sold them to Marvel. So Spawn's Angela is now sister to Thor and Loki! Weird. \\n About halfway through I loved the change in art style - but I couldn't figure out who the artist was. The inking in that section was pretty cool, too. \\n One unfortunate thing was that this crossed over with the Age of Ultron storyline, so I think that some of the story ended up over there and didn't make it into this book.\", 'Jesus.', \"There are a lot of reasons why I didn't particularly like this book. The fact that I just read the American Vampire graphic novel series, that there are vampires in the marvel universe, and that this is the second book in this series are the main reasons. The art was good, and while I enjoyed some of the references to other superheros/villians, overall I just felt the book was lacking. The plot and characters were clishe and by the time I got to the climax, I couldn't even enjoy it. I did like that the maim character was a POC and that it wasn't something that was the focus of the plot, it just was but I feel his character could have been built better. Maybe it was in the first volume, but here he was just a guy who hated his father and liked to kill vampires. A lot.\", 'it was a really great book i recommenced the series basically the series is full of Acton and comedy', \"2.5 is an adequate rating for this book. I love the detailed art in Octopus Pie, but the ennui and hipster mentality of the characters doesn't do much for me. I know it is quite a hit online, so it obviously works for some people, but I'll probably be skipping the rest.\", 'Despite all of the technical stuff discussed in this book, I feel the story was well conveyed. For the most part, whenever I failed to fully grasp what was being discussed, and it did happen more than a few times, I considered it to be adding to the mystery and eccentricity of Turing. Whether you have an interest in technology, mathematics, or rare genius, you could do far worse.

'Thanks to my cousin for suggesting this ;)', \"Who knew a game of marco polo could be so sad? \\n The best part of this volume is that the readers finally start to get some answers, which is good, because there's not going to be another trade for a long time yet. Some of the more villain type characters get some depth, and it turns out they're not really evil but rather misguided. I'm still not a fan of the regular art, but I liked the rough nature of the flashbacks. \\n Overall, I can't say I'm that heartbroken there's no fourth volume yet, but I'll probably pick it up to read when it does eventually come out.\", \"I didn't expect much when I begun reading this manga and was surprised by how good it was. I really enjoyed reading it. It was sweet, funny and still had a serious note. I even found out I already read and really liked two of his works, 'beast master' and 'dengeki daisy'.\", \"Women-focused silkpunk? How could I say no? And the art looked pretty, too. \\n ...I guess I liked it. It was certainly interesting. The worldbuilding comes together slowly--I had a pretty good idea what was going on by the end of this volume, but the road to get there was at-best confusing. \\n I actually like the characters. For all the horrific stuff in their world/backstory/actions, they're fairly relatable. The world itself is... disturbing. Kind of feels survival/horror/fantasy-esque, with a little more horror than I actually enjoy. \\n Art-wise, it's pretty, but it also feels washed out. That might be a printing issue, but it was definitely a barrier to my enjoyment. \\n Final verdict: sadly, it isn't grabbing me. Nothing wrong with it, just... not really for me.\", \"Another great volume. It started out in the Governor's camp right after our survivors escaped and showed the intervening time from their point of view. It quickly got the point where the last volume ended. There was a lot of action and the death toll was high. The fates of a lot of characters are up in the air. Once again, I can see elements that the TV show borrowed but changed up a little. My goal is to get caught up on the comics before the show resumes in February.\", 'Minx. \\n This was fine. I appreciate that the authors tried to address issues of environmentalism and ecoterrorism within a graphic novel for tween girls. But like a couple of other Minx titles, I felt like they tried to do too much for the restrictions of the publication. Crushes on an almost family member, friendship with an \"enemy,\" and domestic violence/alcoholism are all touched on, but I wanted more from the story. The ending felt like a cop-out to me. \\n But yay for setting it in the NW!', 'Super quick but super interesting and unique. Loved the voice and just loved it in general. However, did feel that it played on stereotypes a little.', \"Not my kind of graphic novel, so it was hard to get into it at the beginning... but once you're in, you are in. \\n Gorgeous story.\", 'Yet another book I\\'m counting among the Buddyreads for Indie Week with my too-cool-for-real-books Shallow Comics Readers. \\n Good story, keeps me coming back, and let\\'s just keep rolling on through. \\n Dudes, one big however: I find I\\'m already losing track of who\\'s who and who did what to/with whom. Even my copious plot notes from last volume aren\\'t helping me. One problem with black & white art for me is I get confused when there are multiple characters who are wearing the dark jacket, or a long scarf. At least with superheroes their ridiculous primary colour costumes give you additional colour cues to help you keep em straight. (Still doesn\\'t always help on a team like X-Men, where there\\'s 10x the characters as there are distinct shades of colour in the rainbow.) \\n When shit starts to get apocalyptic, that\\'s when Moore\\'s so-subtle-you-might-think-it\\'s-dead sense of humour comes out to play. (Or else I\\'m one sick mofo.) Sometimes a touch of Three Stooges, sometimes just the sarcastic dialogue between characters. \\n And I like the touches of historical research Moore throws in - about witches, about being buried alive. Nice little diversions to add some weight and anchor down the complete fantasy of all this story. The longer it goes on, the more Aunt Johnny is our Greek Chorus stand-in - only more sciency and lesbian. \\n I\\'m committed to this storyline now, and in dying to understand how it all fits together and who will win in the end (I\\'m rooting for Rachel but secretly I hope Jet redeems her slacker, sarcastic self). \\n Weird thing: in the Comixology version of this trade at least, there\\'s ads after every issue for other books by Terry Moore including one called Terry Moore\\'s How To Draw Women. I don\\'t mind a respectful artist going down this road, but something about the cover skeeves me out: not sure if it\\'s the fact that the cover model is a DD, or that she\\'s spilling out of her ill-fitting suit, or that she\\'s wearing thigh-highs, or that her companion is holding one of her high-heeled shoes so casually. Like, what is the backstory on that shoe? Did woman 1 drop it on purpose? Does woman 2 have a barely-concealed shoe fetish?

I don't like Tim Drake. I actually activley hate Tim Drake. And I know exactly WHY I hate Tim Drake- because he replaced Jason Todd, who is without question my favorite Robin. Yes, the exact reason people in the '80's didn't like Jason (because they felt like he was a slimy opportunist who just wanted to replace Dick Grayson.) is the reason I hate Tim. That and he's always at the right place at the right time, and he's always got good ideas, and he seems to never make mistakes (at least in this comic). He's like the Wesley Crusher of the Batman Universe. \\n The one really redeeming thing about this book was how much I learned about Dick Grayson himself. He's a much more interesting character than I had thought before, and I really like the guy. Also the panels of Bruce just being really sad about Jason dying were fun, as always. \\n This book is worth a read if you're REALLY into the history of the Robins. Otherwise, maybe not the most important read.\", \"I knew that this was a difficult book but I didn't know exactly how. I was glad that I had avoided spoilers. Humorously I did not realize that this book was Brad Meltzer until after I was sitting in comic book club waiting to discuss it but as soon as I realized it just made sense. The ominous nature and the sense of conspiracy all fit. I do think that the role of women in this book is problematic. It's not so much the handling of what happened but that the role of the women is so limited for most of the book. \\n I did love the culmination of whodunnit, I wish I could talk more about it but I think they laid the groundwork fairly well. The other death that occurs bothers many because it makes a certain character more homogeneous with his group (hint hint) and while I am not an avid DC reader I can definitely see where that frustration would come from. I did appreciate getting to see Batman take on his role as detective a bit more. I also am fascinated by the concept that the B-listers make sacrifices to allow the A-listers to have plausible deniability. The idea that being a super hero isn't as shiny as it may seem to be. \\n Original Review on my Website\", 'Matt McGinnis (Terry\\'s brother) has left Gotham and headed to the ruins of Metropolis with his souvenir from the war with Brother Eye. As Tim tries to find him, Gotham is besieged by refugees. \\n This is definitely the start of a new arc since everything is back on a slow build-up. I like the idea of Gotham being this sort of island in the storm with people trying to get their for their survival. The moral dilemma of how the city handles it should be interesting to see, as well as what role Batman will play in it. \\n Equally interesting is seeing what the rest of the world is like now. We get our first real sense of the devastation that hit Metropolis, and I\\'m anxious to see more of what\\'s happening there. I haven\\'t really warmed up to Matt McGinnis yet, but maybe this little adventure will bring his character into better focus and take him beyond the \"annoying little brother\" stage. \\n Additionally, we get a flashback to the demise of the Justice League Beyond - or at least some of them. Some meet their end off panel, but its nice to put the whole thing into perspective. I read some of the digital series and found the characters interesting, but I\\'d like to see more of them. \\n Decent issue that opens up a lot of things for this new world.', 'Oof! Really tough.

Bill Willingham has taken familiar characters, like Snow White and the Big Bad Wolf, and given them new life and new purpose. This series constantly leave me speechless, in a good way, at the twists and turns that you never see coming. And the art work for each issues is always spectacular. The characters live and breathe on the page and there is such depth to the world around them that I always have to go back through and relook at the issue just to see what I might have missed. \\n In this collection, which collects issues #94-100 plus its normal little extras like the covers for the series, we learn more about Rose Red, as the title would suggest. (Some spoiler may follow) After Mr. Dark invaded Fable Town all of the fables have been forced to live at the farm and different factions are arising battling to rule. Rose Red, having been in a depression since Boy Blue passed away, once again comes to the center of things. We learn more about her and Snow White's past, and the mysterious entity that appears to be Colin, formerly one the three pigs, comes back again. \\n The highlight of this collection of course is issue #100 where the battle between Frau Totenkinder and Mr. Dark comes to a head. There are some surprising twists in the story and fans of the Fables series will not be disappointed. \\n I highly, highly recommend this collection and look forward to the next one.\", \"This was one of those books I just picked up at random when I first started reading comics.

Fun graphic novel read for girls going off to camp grades 5-9.', \"Volume 13 isn't really a continuation of Death Note's story per se, it's more of an 'added features'/encyclopedia of the franchise. \\n It is surprisingly stocky, with several sections: character fact files, author/artist interviews, comedic one shot stories, the original pilot chapter, and a few other slices n dices. For example, it'll tell you EXACTLY who touched each note book at what time. Which is stuff you'll eat up voraciously when you're in the throes of the agonising DN withdrawal symptoms. (And if you've just read Volume 12, I'd say you HAVE to be there. Unless yo' crazy.) \\n Of the lot, my favourite parts were the fact files (I'm such a geek for fact files) and the interviews. \\n Particularly the fact files for the shinigami - we even get to learn all about those random ones that showed up in, like, one panel. I'd say Deridovely is my fave - awesome (read: random!) name and cool appearance. Although the one called Justin has a pretty great name too. Just because it sticks out SO MUCH! I mean, they're all death gods! They all have weird kooky names and then there's this one called Justin hanging around with them? But I'll prolly let him off that because Justin the Jewel Skeleton (his full name) rocks. And I love that one of the shinigami's favourite things is blueberries. N'aw, I'd like to be possessed by him. \\n The book also answers a few of those niggly (probably inconsequential) questions - for example, L's ethnicity is revealed to be a quarter Japanese, English (woo!), Russian, and French. verrrrryinteresting. \\n And it was so fascinating to delve into the minds of the geniuses behind DN. God, I love those guys' minds. I swear their attention to detail knows no bounds. And they just sound like a couple of really top guys. I wanna be their friends! Maybe we could sit and come up with twisty death-ridden manga plots all day. \\n Okay, okay - I must admit, there were a few bits I skimmed... No way do I need to read EVERY SINGLE rule of the note book again, for example. I got all that from reading the series. \\n Basically, if you loved Death Note, what are you waiting for? This'll be the best thing since sliced bread. If you didn't so much (well, for starters I'd suggest getting your head checked), you should probably stay away.. This'd be like peeling off your own eyelids.\", \"I have enjoyed this series so far. The art is beautiful, full of despair and desolation and the overall effect is that of The Walking Dead meets Camus's The Plague. However, this one was lacking in terms of plot development. It is far too contrived and it seems like huge coincidences happen out of nowhere. The first four were brilliant but this one, was too heavy on the pseudo-Biblical references.\", \"The second volume begins to fill in the character development that the film didn't have time for. It seems that Kim the drummer is the character most truncated by the film version. This action-heavy installment brings Knives and Ramona into conflict, features Scott's bout with evil ex #2 Lucas Lee, and introduces The Clash at Demonhead featuring Scott's ex Envy. I think I liked this volume a bit more than the first becasue of the surprises, and look forward to more.\", 'Odio a Steve.', 'Geoff Johns takes over the writing duties full time, and does a great job with these characters.

Il numero si apre con un bello scontro, molto sanguinoso, fra un drappello di soldati e una banda di ghoul. Scontro che vede Myrva, la sorella di Ian, soccombere e arrivare a un passo dalla morte. E' l'inizio dell'investigazione condotta da un senatore della capitale dell'impero, la cui figlia e stata rapita dai briganti, insieme con un drappello di cavalieri Candaryani (un corpo scelto che utilizza un'arma peculiare, un incrocio fra lancia e spada). Il capo dei ghoul si dimostra un individuo tutt'altro che sprovveduto: capace di parlare il linguaggio degli umani, studia un modo per sbarazzarsi dei soldati e depredarli del riscatto per la figlia del senatore. La tattica e semplice: un assalto in forze e, come sorpresa finale, l'utilizzo di un ferocissimo trollghast, una specie di grossa pantera. Peccato che, contro di lui, si schieri il varliedarto, e il suo sangue di drago annulli il tempo, consentendo a Ian di avere ragione della bestia.

Freaking awesome. \\n But unfortunately, that world is let down substantially by the writing, story, and art. The story feels disjointed and lacks some internal coherence, which is a major no-no in a comic format; her dialogue can often feel hackneyed and cliche; and some of it is almost cartoonish. And then there's the art. I know this isn't the Avengers or Iron Man or one of the other first-tier Marvel titles, but it really feels amateurish, especially in the last couple of issues. \\n As someone who is desperate for this kind of title (my main reads from the big two are Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, A-Force, the new Thor, and Ironheart), I'm so happy it exists, but as someone who wants the quality writing/art of Bitch Planet, Rat Queens, etc., it's a major letdown.\", \"Too violent for me right now.

The first volume delivers a good promise that Azzarello's run on Wonder Woman will be just that. We don't get as much character development as I would have hoped for, but it's a good setup. I also didn't like the twist of making Diana Zeus's daughter. Her actual origin was far more interesting, being made from clay. Now she's just a daughter of Zeus. However, given the events and reveals around DC Universe: Rebirth (2016) #1, it all makes sense. \\n The art was ok--the last two issues were definitely a little better. I loved how imaginative the look of the gods were. Especially Hades. Hermes looked a little too much like Silver Surfer and Darwin from the X-Men.

It's not even so much that I'm not a huge fan of his style (although that's definitely part of it) but it's just so jarringly different than the other art in the series. It just drives home the (incorrect) point that the writer is the main creator of the comic and all others can just be shuffled in and out. I don't think that is the case at all and I prefer creative teams to share a title until it ends or they are fully replaced by a new team. \\n But on the story side I actually did really like the story.

Many of the charcters faces seem sketchy and occasionally unrecognizable.

I've known those to be a fake for as long as I've known they existed. The Plot The Secret Story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion isn't even the first book I've read on the subject, though it is the best. I read Eco's The Prague Cemetery and found it repetitive and boring, though not without humor and clever devices. Still, I read it because I'm a fan of Eco, and I was interested in the premise. The latter is what led me to this book. \\n I wasn't aware of antisemitism until I married my wife. Actually, it was years after that I realized the extent of hatred people have for Jews. My wife is Jewish, but didn't really become an active Jew until we moved here to Columbia, South Carolina. Before you laugh, know that Charleston, just an hour or so south, is home to the oldest, continuous Reform congregation in the US. There's a strong Jewish connection. There's also a strong redneck connection, and a (seemingly requisite) history of antisemitism. Sadly, it is probably no worse than anywhere else in the country. \\n So as my wife became more active in her temple, I learned why there are door chimes that ring whenever someone enters a synagogue: Jewish congregants and temple workers need at all times to know when someone enters the building. Down the street, the gigantic Baptist church hires a cop or two every Sunday to direct traffic. Each time my wife's temple has an event, or the conservative synagogue down the street holds a community service, they hire cops, too. Only in addition to the uniformed officers, they get an undercover detective or two. Not because they're paranoid, but because of tracks like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. \\n Someday, if i'm lucky enough to have children, they will be Jews. And there will be plenty of people in the world who will hate them for that simple fact. What makes this graphic novel so powerful is not the actual quality of it-- the dialog sounds like an infomercial at times-- but that it seeks to un-do the damage this tract started a century ago. I am doubtful it will, but here's hoping. What the book makes very clear toward the end is that people keep believing in the Protocols because they want to.

Man, is that even possible? fiction as it is but we still have to be close to reality. Chris Claremonts heavy text and poor writing kills the thrill also.

It seemed like a book I'd love. It has all of those in it, and a great cover to boot. The synopsis made it sound like something I'd love, and would probably be the next series I collect. \\n Well, I'm not. And I don't love it. I barely even liked it. \\n The book starts out alright--the first chapter serves as an introduction to Anise's world, and introduces her knights. It's perfectly fine, as far as first chapters go. \\n The rest of the book was a big let down, though. While it did continue from chapter to chapter (the characters do have to keep trying to locate Anise's choker), but it felt way too episodic for me. Each of the subsequent chapters features one of the guys as the focus, and to be honest, I just couldn't get into those chapters. Chapters that were supposed to develop those characters just revealed how the manga is full of stock characters, and that there would be some issue of the day in every chapter from then on. I don't think I want to read 8 more volumes of episodic chapters that have one small thread connecting them. Maybe it gets better in book two, but when a book is just almost a bunch of short stories with boring characters (though Anise herself isn't bad, but I know I'd have to put up with the knights, and I can guess who her love interest is from the start. I hate those kinds of stories. D:), and we get no answer regarding why the choker is so important in the first book, I'm not interested anymore. Maybe I'd continue it if the library around here gets it, but as it stands, I don't want to finish buying it. It's not worth it to me. \\n Other things to take into consideration: \\n The art doesn't look nearly as nice in the book as it does on the cover. Anise is pretty much drawn as she is on the cover, but the boys are generally drawn with strangely shaped faces and lanky proportions. And like another review said, it is hard to tell what's going on sometimes. \\n Just avoid this if you like fantasy and/or romance manga.

Simonson does a good job texturing the world, setting up secondary protagonists, and making the tone highly stylized.

And as their Gods about to be awaken up from their dream to judge the life on earth, they also need to get conscious and unite.

Just jeeze. \\n I also love how Jesse stays out of it for the most part. He lets Tulip do her thing and doesn't fight the battle for her. He supports her but doesn't do the work for her and that's a big step from earlier in the series. I almost don't care at this point whether Jesse and Tulip even accomplish the main goal of the series - I just want to see how the human drama plays out above all else.\", \"Pretty good start off with some alums of the old-school flight. \\n I always liked captain marvel as a character so seeing her like that's is super cool.\", 'This may be the best Atomic Robo collection yet. These five issues look at Robo in four time periods (the 1920s, the 1950s, the 1970s, and the present), and the unifying element is a Lovecraftian monster that, appropriately enough, comes from the body of H.P. Lovecraft himself. The story structure is brilliant, with each section coming together neatly at the end, and the sense of innocent fun that I now expect was certainly present. I also love the character of Lovecraft, how he reflects a racism that is not consciously malevolent but is undeniably ignorant, like much of the literature of his day, and he is a hilarious pathetic joke of a character when paired with someone like Robo, who has a timeless charm about him. Like earlier volumes, the art in this collection is fantastic, with clean lines and a lot of energy, and the dialogue is as funny as ever. Also, someone unfamiliar with the two earlier volumes could still pick up this book and enjoy it, so I recommend it for everyone.', \"Dressrosa Arc, one of the best arc i've read. more mysteries unveiled, it's getting more and more intriguing as time passes by.\", 'loved it....', \"this series is great in how it paces the humor with the action and more serious aspects.

This book is definitely intended for a young audience. I think even most teens would find the descriptions simplistic. I was disappointed by the lack of depth in information - no mention, really, of what series the characters were primarily found in, no real info about who the heros were before their current incarnation (for example, the Robin entry only has info on the current Robin, with no details about who the previous boy wonders were). There's also some spoiler-y stuff happening with no warning. Some backstories seemed to gloss over fairly significant parts. \\n Overall, this book would probably be a good gift for a comics lover around the age of 10. For everyone else, I'd definitely recommend The DC Comics Encyclopedia for more in-depth information and more entries.\", \"[There may be some vague spoilage, but it's still perfectly edible. Edifying. Whatever.] \\n Undoubtedly the smelliest comic ever published, especially for any readers with a touch of synaesthesia. But don't let that scare you off. Light some scented candles or smoke some pot, you'll be fine. \\n So... a young couple are attacked by a dead fish skittering around on an automated spider-like prosthesis. The stench is almost as horrifying as the sight of it, symptomatic of a deadly and highly communicable virus. Even worse, it's not a freak occurrence... well, it IS a truly freakish occurrence, but it's not isolated. More of the plague-fish are crawling from the ocean, everything from Halibut to Manta-Rays, from Squids to Great White Sharks, moving with a frightening speed, rotting and bloated and spreading the intolerable death-stench with them inland. The virus soon becomes an epidemic, moving from the fish to humans with great efficiency... and so do the mysterious, apparently self-replicating machines. \\n There's plenty of wutdafuq weirdness here, because Ito's a black-belt in wutdafuq; Uzumaki fans will recognize immediately wutdafuq I'm babbling about, and probably won't find it surprising that the profound oddness goes far beyond the zombie-fish-robots. As grotesque as it can be, Ito never tests his reader's patience, maintaining a ballistic pace that partly explains the universal popularity of such defiantly unconventional subject matter. Ito's got some serious narrative talents, and his story-telling is always remarkably accessible, even though it's coming at you from some very odd angles. I won't risk busting my taped-together brain trying to explain and ruin it for newbs, even though ruination is a hobby of mine... \\n Junji Ito's greatest work thus far is usually considered Uzumaki, and I won't disagree with that assessment. But I've got a soft spot for this wondrous little scribbled-scrapbook of craziness. Ito has a habit of jamming his narrative steering wheel into the most misshapen, strangely constructed stories you're likely to find, and somehow coaxing an amazingly fast and smooth ride out of them. His razor-sharp line-work -- equal parts Katsuhiro Otomo and Kazuo 'The Drifting Classroom' Umezu -- makes all the rotting and bloating and stinking so much worse (by which I mean better)... even the smell seems to translate. Unlike a lot of the manga being adapted for English audiences, this two-volume work wraps up with a surprisingly brisk under-500-page jaunt.

Will I be disappointed? Knowing me, probably but this version didn't disappoint. It's a gritty urban fantasy brought to vivid life with bright colors and beautiful artwork and it left me hanging for more. \\n Eugenie Markham, usually known as only as Odile the Dark Swan to the beasties she sends back to the Lands of Death, is all badass beautiful with her tats, violet eyes and fiery hair. She's a shamanic mercenary who tracks down evil creatures for a living. But strangely her latest monster knows her real name. It's disquieting and something is definitely afoot that will no doubt cause her later grief but the reasons are not revealed here. \\n She's asked to retrieve a missing girl abducted by the fairies (gentry) which will require her to cross over into the Otherworld. Something she never does. She ponders it even though it's wildly dangerous because, apparently, these aren't your nectar sipping fey. Does she go? Well we don't find that out either. Yet. \\n A small cast of characters are introduced along with Eugenie and they all have fun little quirks. Roomie Tim dresses up as an American Indian because it gets him chicks, Eugenie does cute little kitty puzzles to decompress and then there's super hunky love interest and veterinarian Kiyo who is gorgeously drawn and heats up the pages. There is violence, bad language and sexuality (and some rough-ish sex) in this here ebook so I wouldn't let your nosey youngsters snoop over your shoulder as you read. All of the choice bits are cleverly hidden (darn) but it's spicy all the same. \\n I thoroughly enjoyed Storm Born and will do my best to track down the rest of these graphic versions as they're released. My only small niggle was one bit of dialogue that could easily have been left out or reworded because it left me wondering how Eugenie jumped to a certain conclusion about a man and his driving skills but it's a minor nit in a very entertaining story.

It was everything that I loved about the Super-Friends cartoon but more and better. More heroes, more villains and more action. To my ten year old self it was exactly the escape I needed to help me deal with the fact that I had just moved a long way from everything I had known. It was also a way to help me make friends in my new environment. We would discuss Crisis endlessly at school and that helped me fit in with the other kids (some of them anyway) in my class.

It brings together pieces of story that I thought were just background or character development. Nice move. I think my only problem here is with the character of Jason (the bad guy). He's too obviously bad. The guy never does anything remotely redeeming and so when his skull is fed to a dragon (which was awesome, by the way) it's a good thing. I couldn't understand why these two guys were friends at all. That really didn't make sense.

The ending sets it up to start the series - and it looks promising. The characters and art are good, but it looks like the first issue just sets the scene for the story. I won't really know how to feel until the story states to get going.\", 'One of my favorite manga series, for many reasons. A lot of popular manga has a bad reputation for having the story just never end, which makes people question how much of a story they really even have; but this one has a definitive end after 12 volumes (unlike, say, One Piece, which is going on 65 vols now I believe - and at about $10 a piece...that ain\\'t cheap). In addition, it reads almost like traditional novels - lots of text and dialogue, and won\\'t last you only 30 minutes to an hour like some manga volumes do). I guess what I\\'m saying is that this doesn\\'t feel like filler at all, ever. \\n It also surprisingly has a few moral implications, and at least has you thinking about things even outside the manga itself. The basic story is that Ryuk, a death god, drops the titular Death Note into the human world for someone to find, since he\\'s bored with his own realm and wants to see some chaos stirred up. The Death Note itself is a notebook where one can write the name of a person and their cause of death, and that person will die that way within minutes. \\n The finder of this notebook happens to be Light, a 17 year old at the top of his class, who is also utterly bored with the world, like Ryuk. Once he realizes what he has, he decides that it would be a wonderful idea to use the notebook to start offing criminals, in order to \"clean up the world\". While this sounds like a good idea at first, the series does begin to question how big of a right that is for one man to have, and the implications of it all - for how do we know this whole \"cleaning up the world\" isn\\'t just a front for Light to murder for the joy of murder? It isn\\'t immediately clear, especially given some of Light\\'s actions, which I won\\'t spoil here. \\n This also kicks off a search for who is killing all these criminals, a paranormal investigation rooted in reality, so to speak. On this side is a man named L. Again, we can\\'t be sure that his actions are pure-hearted either...for just as much as he talks about bringing the killer to justice, he too does horrible things to get to his goal, which is sometimes justice, but more often seems to be personal glory. \\n Both sides are egotistical, questionable geniuses, and no one is really the true hero here...the series lets you decide who is right and wrong, in that regard. Though both sides are essentially antiheroes, they\\'re given such interesting personalities, that it\\'s hard not to fall in love with them and keep reading anyways. \\n This isn\\'t the deepest series in the world, but it\\'s definitely more thoughtful than a lot of other manga I\\'ve read so far, and it\\'s always been a personal favorite of mine, ever since I picked it up at its initial American release. Highly recommended, even for those that don\\'t care for manga.', \"We have the stereotypical cool, controlling male lead and the stereotypical wide-eyed, submissive female lead.

Betul-betul ditahan penyelesaian konfliknya sampai buku terakhir, dan semua konflik yang dibangun dikebut selesai dalam satu buku saja. Mungkin itu yang membuat buku terakhir ini kurang memuaskan untuk saya. \\n Secara selera pribadi, saya lebih suka kalau akhirnya berbeda. (spoiler ending! jangan buka spoilernya kalau belum baca bukunya.) \\n Saya lebih mendukung Tsukasa sama Kei. Walau sejak awal memang Hisashi yang duluan dekat dengan Tsukasa dan menyembuhkan trauma-nya. Dan, rasanya kok masalah Tsukasa dengan Sayaka bisa selesai dengan begitu mudahnya? Padahal obsesi Sayaka ke kakaknya, Hisashi, menurut saya cukup berat kalau dilihat di buku-buku sebelumnya. Tapi dia kok bisa maafin Tsukasa gitu aja? \\n Kei yang berbalik mendukung Tsukasa dengan Hisashi juga menurut saya klise. Apalagi masa lalu Kei tetap jadi misteri dan nggak terungkap sampai akhir. Asumsi saya sebelumnya, mungkin Kei dan Hisashi itu saudara satu ibu, atau malah Kei dan Tsukasa yang ada hubungan sedarah, berhubung masa lalu Tsukasa dengan kakeknya cuma diceritakan sepintas lalu. \\n Saya juga masih nggak rela Sayaka jadian sama Kei.

The base plot of tracking down and dismantling a multi-national crime ring to its sources was well executed. I even liked the fact Helena and Renee thought it made more sense to buy off the hitman sent to kill them instead of spending endless pages fighting. What I did not like was the introduction of Vandal Savage towards the end as the crime ring's head, and what I think was editorial's decision to introduce the whole Book of Cain story angel and to shove that onto Renee.

The stories are fun, the art is great. Jerry Siegle knew how to tell a story in concise comic book terms. Joe Shuster's art is functional; it does what it has to do and doesn't throw in any unnecessary details. \\n We get here the original Superman who instead of flying could leap 1/8 of a mile, who was strong and powerful but not ridiculously so, and who was not invulnerable as nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin. In fact, if you painted him green and gave him a grouchy temper, you'd have the Hulk. (Proof once again that other writers retroactively ripped off Stan Lee at every opportunity. Anne will understand that.) \\n The complaint or disappointment comes in the format or layout of the book. Although it is a large coffee table volume, the comic pages are too shrunken and it gave me eyestrain trying to read the panels. The art stands out but the lettering is soooo very tiny I needed a magnifying glass to read it. \\n Still it was great to revisit a hero who, while super, was still realistic enough to be believed. \\n Bruce Timm, great and talented as he is, did a disservice to comics by setting an unrealistic template that everyone copies. Heroes now follow the cookie-cutter pattern of being tall with a deep large chest, narrow waist, and square jaw that covers half his face. (I can see this look for Superman and Flash, but why do Green Lantern or Hawkman need to look like that?) All women are small, slim, and pointy jawed, but have enormous hooters. The only variety is in the color of the costume or the color of the hair. Otherwise everyone looks alike. If shown in black and white you'd have a hard time telling any of them apart. \\n Joe Shuster's characters looked like real people. The sizes and physiques varied. It was a nice world back then, simple and adequate and fun.\", 'SM', 'L und Light sind viel zu schlau fur diese Welt. Und die Schlinge um Light wird immer enger gezogen...

So why is it that he doesn't kill anyone? All he does is beat his opponents up. Why doesn't he kill them in his towering rage, just like he did so many of his enemies when he was exiled on the planet. If he's meant to be at war, he should act like he's at war. \\n Also, just because he's super angry doesn't mean he can defy the laws of physics or ignore his limitations. The Hulk cannot fly, yet in this book he is depicted fighting the Sentinel high above the streets of New York without his falling to the ground. Groan. \\n The only saving grace in this book as far as I'm concerned is the interaction between the Hulk and Rick Jones. \\n One to be missed.\", \"One of the best altogether plots I have ever read.

You have the first volume collected and then the volumes of New X-men Academy X (which is what this title morphs into) but not this arc. It just seems odd, particularly as some decently important things happen through these issues. But I digress. \\n I thought that this story arc was strong but maybe not quite as strong as the first. The first volume felt like a love letter to fans of the original New Mutants series. This one is beginning to feel like its own thing. This is, of course, a good thing - even if I do personally miss the New Mutants nostalgia lovefest of before. \\n The new characters are developing though some seem more like cardboard cutouts still than fleshed out characters. The storyline seems to have been interrupted a bit by what was going on in the main X-titles (which is unfortunate if true as this series is better than the main books) but the writers handled it well. Would have been nice to see the battle with Magneto from their perspective rather than just getting some exposition through Dani's dialogue. \\n In general, I am still very pleased with this series and am excited that it will maintain the same creative team going in to New X-men Academy X. I am looking forward to reading more, to seeing where they take this story and these characters in the future.\", 'Parah banget -_- gak di Indonesia gak di luar negeri polisi kelakuannya pada begitu.. \\n Wah ga bagus ini kalo dibaca polisi nanti mereka niru(?) \\n Kurang lucu, tapi ironis.', 'After reading Alan Moore\\'s \\'Absolute Top Ten\" a large emptiness grew in me.

This is a great story all on its own, fascinated with the creation of Neopolis, Naziism, the occult, artificial intelligence, and homosexuality while all these themes are shown with brilliant insights into society\\'s organizing groups. Ordinary citizens walking the streets are dirty comic strip characters, the cast of characters has yet to be born with a few exceptions who we get to witness interacting with some of our favourite character\\'s relatives, and the third act amps up with descending bats transforming into vampires going up against robots and a cast of desperate citizens of Neopolis.

I've read Paul Tobin's work before in Bandette, Volume 1: Presto! and was hoping for more of the same wit. While it showed on occasion in Burma, it was completely lacking in the main character Allison Breaking and her friend Reggie, who wandered aimlessly through the plot. Allison exists only to be Burma's patsy, an investigative blogger too taken in by the talking cat to ask any of the important questions. \\n The stories of Burma's past were far more interesting than the action in the present, so the brief skimming treatment didn't give them sufficient time. His plots in the present are interesting, but full of holes. Fun when you aren't paying attention. Overall it was a tolerable read for a few hours, but not one I'd go for again.\", 'I breezed through Volumes 3 and 4 quickly last night, so points for the overall Buffy v. Twilight story arc for keeping me up at night. I expressed the basic plot points to my husband and honestly if you tell a fellow Buffy fan what\\'s going on in the comics, there\\'s a good chance they\\'re going to say either \"Buh?\" or make a snorting noise, because it sounds goofy as hell. \\n Volumes 1 and 2 indicate that Buffy funds her Slayer army of fierce warrior women by robbing European banks, which is no longer touched upon and there are no consequences whatsoever. TV Buffy\\'s ideals and morals don\\'t mesh with Season 8 comic Buffy, but I guess if there\\'s no Watcher\\'s Council and no govt aid, how else is she going to fund the armories and all the Slayer group breakfasts? I guess Joss really wanted dramatic European and Asian backdrops and there\\'s NO way you can do that without crime. Means to an end, I guess. \\n Anyway! I was glad to see Oz again, and I like that Willow has conflicting-weird-jealous feelings regarding the fact that he\\'s got a family and lives peacefully in Tibet. One big issue throughout the show and the comics is bisexual erasure. Every character is either gay or they\\'re not. There are no transgender folks, gender fluid, asexual, aromatic, nope nada peeps. I know that imagination doesn\\'t run out, so if you can imagine that Buffy\\'s sister, Dawn, was changed into a giant, a centaur, and a wee doll because of a curse from a demonic college boyfriend, then I bet you could also imagine that a few characters are bisexual. One minor romantic subplot that ends quickly in Volumes 1 and 2 is Buffy\\'s brief tryst with another slayer, Satsu. Satsu awakens Buffy from a magical coma with true love\\'s kiss, and that ought to have some weight to it, right? Eh, not so much. They have sex twice, then it\\'s business as usual with everyone telling Satsu, \"You\\'re gay and Buffy\\'s not. Stop this.\" Um...K. Is that how sexuality works in the Whedon universe? Going back to Willow, she explains she\\'s jealous because Oz has a family and he\\'s \"normal\" and acts like he betrayed her for leaving. There\\'s nothing wrong with acknowledging that there\\'s one last lingering mushy feeling for Oz, even though she\\'s devoted to Kennedy, the bratty Slayer everyone loved to despise on the TV show. And I think it\\'s lovely that Willow discovered who she loves romantically and sexually, but everything doesn\\'t have to be gay/not gay. It\\'s so silly! \\n Every once in a while, you will get confused as to whether you\\'re looking at Andrew, Oz, or sometimes even Giles, but good grief these library edition covers with the hyper realistic likenesses are fabulous! Returning back to romantic pairings and mixing in some art style, I think the real reason I\\'m uncomfortable with the eventual pairing of Xander and Dawn is 1) they\\'re relationship felt very older brother/kid sister or cool uncle/annoying niece throughout the show and the comics, plus the art style doesn\\'t help because Michelle Trachtenberg has a beautifully youthful face so her Dawn comic representation looks even younger despite a small age difference between Xander and Dawn (what is it, 5 years difference?). So the age difference isn\\'t a bad thing and the pairing isn\\'t super out of the question, but it does feel like a pairing of convenience. Dawn has made nice with her demon ex, Xander\\'s previous love interest was killed by a vampire (typical), and Buffy\\'s about to get sexy with Angel again, so they HAVE to be with each other! I guess? \\n This was fun.', 'Love it! Watched the korean drama so I had to read the manga.

In the Avengers, a clear and complex enough storyline presents itself on the first pages. Ex Nihilo, creator of change and good in the universe has captured the Avengers and plans to recreate everything in his vision. It's a plot of grand scope, and it completely incapacitates the Avengers which to do at the beginning of a story is pretty bold. It ends up resulting in a much greater resolve of conflict though at the end of the book, and seeing the whole team of Avengers together and rescuing each other is awesome. I really like in this volume that before each issue there is an Avengers crest like thing on the page, along with all of the names of those in the group, and then the ones that are in bold and not faded out are the characters that will be in the issue. It's something small but I thought it was neat to see and keep track of who you'd be looking for in the action in each issue. Other than that, it's a fairly normal comic. The artwork doesn't stand out in any way, but the story does because it's surrounded by a lot of garbage in the rest of the Marvel NOW! catalog currently.

In despair, he takes to his bed, renouncing the world and all its pleasures, closing the door on the demands and love of his wife and children. \\n Nasser Ali selfishly decides to die, but before he does so, he reflects back on his life and we are given a look into his thoughts during the eight days before he passes. This book was fantastically dark and depressing, yet also very poignant and revealing. I didn't know whether to like Nasser Ali or not - but he felt so human. He plays favorites with his children, argues with his wife, can't get over the girl who got away, resents his brother for being their mother's favorite. What shocked me most was the fact that music was such a large part of his life and when he couldn't find a replacement tar he literally decided to die and die he did!

FIZZGIG FTW! #teamfizzgig', \"Even though I'm a really big fan of crime fiction and of graphic novels, books like this one make me feel like comics are just not really the best format to write crime fiction in. This puzzles me because one of the things I like most about crime fiction is how economical and spare the prose in it often is, which should be a natural fit with the comics genre, and comics have so much in common with film, which obviously lends itself marvelously to the noir genre. \\n I would also point out that there are many notable exceptions to what I'm saying within comics in, Mammoth's Best Crime Comics anthology, which is gorgeous and shows the great possibilities there are, Jacques Tardi's West Coast Blues, Matt Kindt's Super Spy, even Black Hole by Charles Burns which has a lot of noir elements. Most of the best examples I mentioned above, however, display two very important things: they feature a distinctive, interesting art style that helps ground the emotional content of the story and tightly written and developed plots which keep you engaged in the twists and turns. As someone who prefers James Cain to Dashiel Hammett, my favorite crime novels actually are vastly more character driven than plot driven, since Cain's plots for example are almost always a very straightforward love triangle + money = murder formula. Something about the graphic novel format, however, makes it a lot harder to pull off character driven crime fiction. \\n For another thing, graphic novels do have a lot of inherently cinematic qualities without having a lot of the important advantages of film. There is still a lot of careful framing of panels and plenty of opportunity to experiment with the light and shadow that is such a common feature of noir in comics. But, what you do not have, is an easy way of controlling how the reading of a graphic novel is paced like you would with a film. You also lack the tone and delivery of the actors and actresses. \\n Crime comics that do not compensate for the lack of these elements ultimately just don't work for me and this book is a good example. The art style is pretty pedestrian, the writing pretty hohum, and the result is that there's no real sense of build up to the climactic scene. I'm sure that some of the passages in this book would work if it was actually in movie format because you'd have so much more to go on in the actors' voices, you'd have a feeling for the characters, you'd have the pacing of the film to propel it forward. Without those things though, this book feels like a limp imitation of its inspirations.\", \"More reviews at Rondo of a Possible World: YA Book Reviews \\n Action-packed, thickening plot, three-dimensional characters, and humor drizzled on each character, Fullmetal Alchemist is a book that should definitely be read by all.

I recommend this to everyone because it's easy to read, the art is gorgeous and the story is funny and very exciting!\", 'My rating is 3.75 stars. I had high expectations for this graphic novel. A friend of mine loves this series, so much that she has a tattoo inspired by the series, and the title is just awesome. You are thrown into the world of the graphic novel without much explanation of what is going on and why the world is the way it is. It took me a little bit to get into the story because I was confused on what was going on. The women are naked a lot in this novel. Nude scenes don\\'t usually bother me but it was a little excessive in my opinion. There were men that called themselves \"Father\" and they weren\\'t priests. That was an interesting but creepy aspect of the story. I really liked the women inmates especially Penny. She\\'s probably my favorite character right now. There are a lot of cuss words but that didn\\'t bother me. I liked the art style, it had a superhero comic feel. I\\'m going to continue with the series, I hope we learn more about the world and what happened to make it the way it is. I liked the novel, I just didn\\'t love it as much as I thought I would.', \"I struggled a bit with the first two trades of this series, but considering how much I enjoy most of Hickman's work, I keep powering through with this. With the third book, my patience has been rewarded to a point, as this is finally what I was expecting from this series. Part origin stories, part plot development, it's as if the first ten issues were all a prelude to things that are happening. \\n Really, really solid, and I'm looking forward to what's next. I'm coming around on this series really quickly and I think it's something more people should be reading.\", 'Felt a bit unfinished, but I liked it.', \"This is the last time curiosity has gotten the better of me... The only thing I can say about this mess is: WHAT. THE FUCK. DID I JUST WATCH! (Read if you prefer, but still is a graphic novel). \\n You know, I've an immense fascination for the Borgias since 2 years ago so I got the TV series with Jeremy Irons. I watched it, liked it (not loved it, it had some flaws it was not perfect, but it was pretty) and then I went and got more documentation about the whole Borgia family. Turns out quite a few authors and mediums haved approached the murderous Borgia family. \\n The aforementioned TV series I think is the one portraying them as the most humane you'll ever get them in any medium. Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood have approached the whole Borgia family, particularly after Cesare takes hold of the Roman Millitary, as well and made Cesare look, well decent, yet he does OOZE villainy all over, whereas in the TV series he is more sympathetic. There are a number of books that focus on the Borgias, some of the writers include: Dumas and Zevaco that deal with the intrigue and murder, a few romance novels centered on Lucrezia and Cesare that I bet see them in a more sympathetic light than Dumas or Zevaco..... Aaaaand then we have this mess. \\n Not gonna lie, I was interested to read what a graphic novel adaptation would look like when attributed to the Borgia story... It's just as aweful as it sounds. \\n Ok... well there might be a few good points given for the drawing style and the use of watercolor, but I am really given flashbacks of reading Game of Thrones graphic novel, more than anything else. It may look pretty but there are two factors that bring the visuals down for me. \\n 1. The characters are TOO STIFF, there's hardly any sense of motion or urgency, given that most of the situations the characters face are urgent in and of themselves. \\n 2. And almost obsessive overreliance on sexuality that I have failed to see in the other mediums that I have researched, be they cinematic, literary or otherwise. I mean there isn't a span of 5 pages before ANOTHER naked/sex scene occurs. I'm not one against sex in a medium, but when if comes up left right and center in the work something tells me that he author has a skewed sense of reality. Yes the first few pages of the first issue kinna set the tone for the whole thing but it got ridiculous into the 4th issue. \\n The characters are anything but humane, they are power hungry and lustful creatures, from their early teens up until adulthood (Cesare and Lucrezia demonstrate this). Even if there is speculation and maybe even proof of the idea that Cesare and Lucrezia had an incestuous relationship, this fact is all but glossed over to make way for other non-important sex scene (and I have to mention a striking one, near the edge of an ACTIVE VULCANO... hwooo! Talk abouyt extreme sports :P) \\n I can't even put into words how awkward this story made me feel... In its entirity it is so... disgusting, it's only saving grace is its drawing style which is amateurish at best, abysmal at its worst. \\n I will include it into my feed because... heck I did read it, but that doesn't mean it will go into my 2015 Challenge reads. It isn't worht a spot up there. Sailor Moon? Yes! This blasphemy to the already blasphemous Borgias? I'd prefer a bazuka going through my skull >.>\", \"Getting better with each chapter...and this cover must be the most beautiful cover I've seen in a while :o\", \"http://nhw.livejournal.com/1121015.html[return][return]Jessica Jones, superhero against her will, confronts her internal demons, both the guilty secret of how she acquired super powers, and her personal nemesis.

So I have no context or preconceived ideas about this story. \\n I mean, it's really not fair to the book that I don't much care for vampire stories. But it was in the cheap bin, and it caught my eye (I actually appreciated the clean lines of the artwork. I dislike cluttered frames in comics, and this didn't have that.), and I like graphic novels. \\n And, you know. Hot comic art guy on the cover. Don't judge me. \\n I didn't care for it. Mainly because just to pick it up and read it cold, there was absolutely no characterization whatsoever. I didn't care about any of the characters. \\n And I didn't care for the complicated mythos that was dumped on me all at once. I get that I am picking it up without any context. But I don't feel a reader should need context. The work should be able to stand on it's own, I and I don't feel it can. \\n I did like the art, though, so I'll give it a point for that. \\n I might feel differently if I had read the books.

I definitely recommend this book!!!', \"I really am enjoying this series, but the pressure on Riiko, by people who supposedly love her, to make this decision about what guy she's gonna pick (and subsequently have sex with immediately) is more than a tad uncomfortable. Riiko is 16. She doesn't need to pick. And the fact everyone is trying to make her to isn't something I'm enjoying.\", \"Charming and poignant. I loved the illustration style.

Supernatural events couple with real-life problems as the married pair have to deal with a rival vampire, inappropriate love stalkers who don\\'t back off even when learning the object of their affection is married (!) and having to find a new home because their old one has been sold out from under them. Oy. It\\'s enough to give a vampire an aneurysm. \\n The action is fun, the characters are very amusing (imagine a tongue-tied werewolf, e.g.) and Marlo gets to explore his female side. The one problem I have with this manga--and it\\'s a biggie--is that there is no sex. David Vincent is a very sexual vampire and adores women. He had sex with the lovely Marlo at the end of \"Until the Full Moon\" vol. 2 so I naturally expected that there would be more sex for the honeymoon phase. \\n But there isn\\'t. Nada, zero, zip, zilch. What the hell?!? There is plenty of kissing and hugging but come on, this is yaoi and sex is expected, especially between a lusty vampire and his nubile husband/wife/consort! To have a mature relationship without sex being depicted is a big let-down after the payoff of the previous series.', 'Wow. Wow, wow, wow! Easily on the BEST graphic novels I\\'ve ever read, 10 out of 10 wouldn\\'t be enough, this should be a clear 11 out of 10! The characters, the plot, the prose, the storytelling, the philosophy... each and every component was absolute pitch perfect. I\\'ve been on a Superman ride for the last week, am a big Batman fan forever (both in comics and screen) and while I always greatly enjoyed Superman on screen from Christopher Reeve\\'s movies to Smallville to Man of Steel, I almost never read any comics. I thought its high-time to rectify that, and have read Superman for All Seasons, Superman: Red Son and Superman: American Alien in very quick succession, found each of them to be a delightfully brilliant 5-star read. But this... this is without a doubt the best of the bunch, it not only entertained me but touched my heart and mind, made me think about human life and its goals and destinies, shone a light on the humanity and the world in both optimistic and cynical perspectives. \\n The funny thing is, even though the book contains \\'Superman\\' in it\\'s title, how it is NOT a Superman story, literally and figuratively. Superman exists in this world only in comicbooks, as a fictional character; the world is just like ours without any superheroes. Here was a boy who had the misfortune of being named \\'Clark Kent\\', and for that all his life he was mocked, taunted and compared with his fictional counter-part. Its an evergreen coming of age tale of that young boy, often bullied and harassed, through his adolescence to his adulthood, love-life, parenthood and beyond. \\n So what the boy suddenly (and inexplicably) got himself some very cool superpowers? That didn\\'t change him as a man, his thoughts, fears, doubts are all ever so genuine and familiar to each and every one of us. We all go through those phases in life more or less in the same way, we can resonate with all of it. Well maybe not in such \\'extra-ordinary\\' circumstances, but still. And that\\'s the most powerful element of this wonderful graphic novel: The voice of our unfortunately named hero. Not once writer Kurt Busiek lost his focus from the main character and his countless inner struggles, he voiced him so perfectly and naturally that even though on the surface all his problems and experiences are comicbookish Supermanly, from the inside we can easily connect and empathize with him as a fellow human. Once in a while in each of our lives, who doesn\\'t feel like an outsider, lonely and isolated from his/her own world and surroundings? Feels like an alien in his/her own home planet? Everyone thinks sometimes in life, \\'There\\'s no one else like me. No one who could truly understand.\\' The biggest triumph of Busiek was his intricate and careful detailing of our hero\\'s underlying \\'Man\\' aspect over his \\'Super\\' persona. Coupled this with his lyrical prose and engrossing storytelling, and what we get is not just another cheap forgettable comicbook, but an unforgettable epic odyssey of a man\\'s journey across life as a literature. \\n I read the most of it today on an \"epic journey\" through traffic jam of my own. The two and a half hours I was on the road moving on a snail\\'s pace, I never once thought about what\\'s happening around me, the endless crowd, the increasing restlessness, the intense heat and humidity... At that time I was flying beyond the sky, breathlessly rushing through the pages, awestruck by its ups & downs, all the while having a mile-wide stupid grin on my face. The perfect blissful contentment of reading something beautiful, spellbinding, fun. And that smile didn\\'t disappear even after I finished it. This is why I read books, to escape the exhausts of daily realities for a while, to feel and understand me myself and my world through extra-ordinary tales of ordinary souls, and returned to face my reality reinvigorated by that. Traffic jam be damned! \\n Maybe I had a \\'secret identity\\', but then when you think about it, don\\'t we all? A part of ourselves very few people ever get to see. The part we think of as \"me\". The part that deals with the big stuff. Makes the real choices. The part everything else is a reflection of. \\n 11 out of 10, A+', \"One of the best graphic novels I've read in a long time!\", 'So happy this manga was made. I greatly enjoyed reading this book.', \"I brought this because it was on sale, but more importantly because it has Uhura on the cover. When I was a kid and watching OST in re-runs, I loved Uhura. I wanted to be Uhura. The only other woman of note was Chapel, and all Chapel seemed to do was moon over Spock. Uhura did things. (Yeah, I know Rand, but really, c'mon). \\n Nichelle Nichols is awesome. \\n Zoe Saldana does a damn fine job as Uhura, and the reboot #3 is awesome, so go away. \\n This edition gives you back stories for Bones, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu, and Chekhov, at least in the Kelvin timeline. It was a fun read. The Uhura story was good. Enjoyable.\", 'So, ever since I first discovered the Addams clan, at the age of 13, I\\'ve been oddly fascinated by these characters. I\\'ve never been particularly fond of the cartoon adaptations of the 90\\'s, but for some reason the film versions took hold of my imagination and never let go. In many ways I think I\\'ve always felt exactly as it is said in the introductory text of this book: \"They might be scary, weird, creepy, and macabre, but The Addams Family is our secret envy. If only our family dinners could be so much fun!\" True that. \\n I\\'ve only recently got acquainted with the 1960\\'s TV version of the characters but I loved them all the same, albeit for different reasons (Morticia and Gomez relation and their parenting stile, Ted Cassidy\\'s Lurch), and now \"The Addams Family: An Evilution\" finally allowed me to reach the end of this weird backwards time-traveling relationship I seem to have with these boys. \\n Chas Addams, the artist who came up with this beautiful concept, had a dark and delightful mind. Every panel is like a snapshot of a moment in the lives of these twisted, creepy people and yet you cannot help but feel there is a real bond between them. The Addams house is as warm as it is dark, and not all of it comes from the boiling oil or the human shaped logs burning in the fireplace. From their traditions, like placing little hang-nooses on the Christmas tree, to Gomez teaching the children how to make their own torture-racks, until the very awesome reading time depicting all the family together, including Uncle Fester holding \"A Return to Morality\", Gomez, fascinated by \"The Total Collapse of The Dollar\" and little Wednesday reading \"The Comfort of Sex\", every image gives us a strange feeling of defiance and gloom embedded with coziness. \\n It was also rather interesting to see what changed over time, and what remained. The character that perhaps had the most drastic transformation was Thing, originally depicted as a mysterious peering figure hidden amongst rafters, behind doors or between snow and not a disembodied hand at all. To my mind the closest adaptation to the cartoon version of the character would very well be some sort of silent spidery ghost child-thing creeping from unexpected places. \\n Gomez also went through a great change, from a slightly greasy man-child (but never the less a clearly lovable parent and husband) depicted in these cartoons to the suave Raul Julia version of the 90\\'s. The stepping point between the two was probably the TV version, who sometimes feels just as greasy as Chas Addams\\'s Gomez, but developed to something a bit different along the way. To be honest, even though I really liked the drawn version of Gomez, this evolution might not have been a bad thing. \\n And there is AT LAST, a very good explanation as to why the 90\\'s films focused so much on Uncle Fester! Apparently he had always been Chas Addams favorite, and the one he felt REALLY depicted himself (don\\'t ask...). There is also a fairly decent justification as to why his place within the family keeps changing from adaptation to adaptation, as Fester\\'s relation to the Addams was never defined, and he was very much a \"stand alone\" character. (Oh, and he is much more evil here than in any other adaptation) \\n Finally there are Chas Addams notes to the TV show producers, that are short but rather insightful. One thing I particularly loved was the fact he clearly pointed out Gomez and Morticia, could, in fact, not be married at all (and that was fine). There was something so delightfully subversive in that suggestion alone, given the time that it was written, that it made Mr Addams gain several points in my personal scale of respect. \\n To sum up, yes, they\\'re as creepy and as kooky, as mysterious and as spooky, still all together ooky as usual (...snap snap...), but they are also rather smart, remarkably subtle and maybe even more subversive than ever. So, please, do come in and meet the Chas Addams Family (...snap snap...).', \"It's cute and Donna's art is appropriate, which is a major plus, but the transitions are sloppy and it ends very abruptly.\", \"The art style definitely took me some time to get used to, but once I had adjusted I really liked it. Nice stuff going on with narration and playing with panel size/placement. I'd check out the next collection if I came across it.\", \"I was first exposed to this series (and publisher) from Free Comic Book Day 2013. I had never heard of Valiant or Manowar until then and I don't know why, but I was naturally attracted to the look, feel, and tone of the art and style of publication. I loved what I read in the free issue and couldn't wait to get more. I finished this first volume and I still haven't read enough of this series! \\n I guess this is a reboot of an older series, and I'm not sure what the plot was, but I love this concept. Aric, a Visigoth soldier, fights for his uncle against the Roman army in 402 AD. His wife is kidnapped along with his baby son, and his father is killed in battle all because he refused to retreat when his uncle said to. Though rash, he is as brave as John Carter and just as much the warrior with loyal followers. I would have read a whole series just of epic battles in ancient Rome, but it gets even more interesting when an alien race intervenes with history, kidnapping Aric and company. \\n I won't give any spoilers, but I highly recommend this comic series. I love the emotion, I love the action, I love X-O Manowar.\", 'Jason, Portia, and Jellaby are on an adventure to find a mystery door.

Well actually they get kicked out but are determined to make the best of it in a large unknown world. That is the beginning of the book Bone written by Jeff smith. What comes next is an epic tale of adventure and Tom foolery as the Bone cousins get lost, meet new friends, find a Dragon and find, not so nice, rat creatures. \\n The three Bone cousins, Smiley Bone, Phon Bone, and Phoney Bone are happy residence of Boneville. Life is going according to plan until Phoney Bone, the con artist of the three, gets booted for running a scam on the other towns people. They find themselves lost in a desert where they get separated by a swarm of locusts. Phon Bone heads off into the Valley, meets Thorn, a mysterious girl who he becomes friends with. Phon is very helpful and tends to do the right thing or the nice thing in most situations. His cousins Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone have a different approach to most situations. Phoney tends to take advantage of other people and run scams as often as possible. Smiley is not too bright and tends to follow other people's example. This puts them in trouble a lot, especially when it is their time to meet Thorn and her Grandma. \\n The author is trying to teach his audience that there is more than one way to handle a situation. The three Bone cousins show you three different approaches. Phon Bone is smart and tries to be nice to everyone and also tries to do the right thing. Usually everything turns out alright. Phoney Bone, on the other hand, is also smart but tries to take advantage of other people he meets and it tends to get him into trouble. Smiley Bone follows either Phon or Phoney and it usually goes well with Phon but not so well with Phoney. Phon actually spends more time getting his cousins out of trouble than anything else. \\n Bone is a fun and entertaining book with a good message and an even better ending.\", \"Volume two of this series is even better than the first one. One of the things I love about this manga is that the mangaka really tries to stay true to how people from Japan's past might respond in a modern setting. Kagetora's emphasis on honor in volume one, his lack of hesitation regarding killing others (until Beni gives her order), and his sense of station are all very well depicted, as well as the complications they cause (or might cause). That same attention continues in volume two. \\n In this volume, Beni and Kagetora are aware of how they feel toward each other. They see each other as equals. However, Kagetora's earlier promise to her father, that he knew his station and wouldn't rise above it, comes back to haunt them. It seems Beni has been promised to a guy named Rihito who attends the same school. And he's creepy, folks. \\n But Kagetora's honor and sense of station kick in. He won't stand in the way if she's already been promised to someone else. After all, he's just her bodyguard. A servant. He won't even touch her now and apologizes for his rude behavior in the past (i.e. kissing her). Eventually, this attitude leads to one of the most intense scenes in the volume when Rihito attacks her at school and Kagetora...doesn't move. It's exactly what I would expect from someone in his position in the past. The fact that he's in agony while he hears what's going on and the fact that he discovers a compromise in time doesn't do much for Beni's anger at him. She still expects him to act as a guy in modern times would if they saw the woman they loved being threatened. \\n Personally, I was amazed he did anything at all to help her. After all, in his mind there's no chance for them to be together, ever, and she might as well belong to Rihito. I'm especially happy that he overcame that to any degree since it means there's a chance he might fit into the modern world. \\n There's some beautiful moments in this volume and the comedy is also pretty strong, in spite of scenes like the one described above. The tone of the plot definitely becomes darker in this volume but never so dark that the tone dramatically changes. It's similar in style to the change between volumes one and two of FullMetal Alchemist. In other words, the plot really takes off in volume two. \\n Kagetora is really amazing in this volume, both in how he's adapting and how he's not. His affection for Beni still runs very deep and we get a small glimpse into his childhood, which explains some aspects of his personality, including his acceptance of what life gives him. He's happy with whatever he can have. \\n And, of course, there's awesome ninja stuff, both from him and his enemy. \\n Beni is still a lot of fun in this volume. Her affection for Kagetora is really helping her open up emotionally. I also like how she does what she can to fight against the obstacles life puts in their way. I'm hoping in the next volume (3) that Kagetora starts fighting them as well.\", \"A picture paints a thousand words. Cliche, but so true. Kyle Baker adds print text, but it's mostly his explicit illustrations that tell this poignant and horrific tale.

I suppose not everything can be kittens and puppies and lovefests all the time. People get depressed, they drift apart, things suck sometimes. Saga, Volume 4 is one of those times. \\n This volume takes place over a couple of years as Marko and Alana & Co. are parked on one planet while Alana makes money for them on The Circuit, a sort of live theater televised broadcast, and she seems to be on some sort of weird soap opera wrestling show. Marko is restless and lonely and exhausted from taking care of Hazel all day. And Alana hates her job, and then makes some questionable decisions. They have a huge blow-out fight near the end of the book, and for a little bit you think that's going to be it, and everything is awful. \\n And then this robot asshole Dengo shows up. Dengo's entire life mission appears to be fucking other people's shit up. \\n This book opens with a truly disgusting and weird image of a robot baby being born. Like, it's a straight up robot vagina shot. It's bloody and gross, and is sort of a weird harbinger of what's to come in that storyline. By the end of the book, the robot baby has been kidnapped, his mother murdered, and his kidnapper isn't shy of murdering anyone else in his way. It doesn't help that the guy has legitimate gripes. But he's still the reason that by the end of the book, Marko and Alana's fight, which I'm convince they could have gotten past, turned into an actual separation, with Marko being left behind, just in time for a newly back from being disappeared Prince robot IV to show up. That last panel was seriously awesome, though. Everybody's out of their malaise, and Marko may be miserable and miss his family, but he's on a mission now, and he's teamed up with Prince Robot to do it. \\n I suppose everything that happened in this volume was necessary. It's fun to watch people come back together, but they have to be separated first, and that part sucks. I don't want Alana and Marko to be mad at each other any more. My emotions are fragile and can't handle it. \\n Help me, Saga, Volume 5, you're my only hope.\", \"Cut very loosely from the same hand-scribbled, sex-and-violence-and-headbanging cloth as Johnny Ryan's Prison Pit, Twelve Gems is nonetheless its own drooling beast.

A pigman, an Amazon and a flying dog race across the galaxy in search of gems of untold power. All have complicated pasts that seem to haunt them, and their quest soon unravels in sprays of laser fire.

If you like cool comics, but only cool comics with high production values that have been pre-approved by the zeitgeist, TG might not yet be on your radar.

It's a fantastic canvas he's painting on with this story - and some interesting backstory sprinkled throughout (Eren and Mikasa, in particular). Biggest problem with it, for me, is ALL THE SHOUTING! Really? Do people need to scream at each other in normal conversation and get devil eyes over even the most minor transgression - Eren in particular. As an anime newb, I have no idea if this 'passionate' dialogue translates into the manga as well, but boy - quite a few characters sure seem to get amped up over the littlest thing. Notwithstanding the fact that there are 100 metre tall colossal titans, armoured titans, and various other monstrous humanoids pounding through humanity's barricade after a century. \\n I'll probably push on with the next batch of episodes on Netflix (I really am enjoying the visuals and master arc); believe the first four volumes (up to chapter 31?) of the manga constitute the first 13 episodes on Netflix.\", 'Tenia ganas de empezar una serie de historietas nueva y la que mas me ha llamado la atencion ultimamente es \"CHEW\".

But...I really like this one. I love when an author turns the simple premise of zombies on its head and takes it in a different direction, with a story that hasn't been done 3000 times before. And that's what I love about this story. \\n Even though you might describe this book as nerd falls for jock love story...how many times do you see the jock be the woman in the relationship? Or that she's also a huge nerd as well. That's what makes this book a different type of love story. And the zombie background? Just adds to the awesomeness of it. The zombie aspect isn't as unique, but that its mixed up with a love story interests me. I also really like the artwork for this novel. There's a lot of depth to it and the expressions on the characters faces really helps sell the book. My biggest complaint with the writing is that they don't pace themselves well in some places. For example on one page it's apparently three or four different days but there aren't enough clues to piece that together. Everything is a bit too fast paced and I would really love to see them slow it down just a bit more. \\n I really do like this story and I look forward to the sequel that's coming.\", 'This was not my favorite installment.

Hikaru, Akira, and Kiyoharu are representing Japan in the Japan-China-Korea Young Lions tournament, with Kurabata Sensei as Japanese team leader. After Korean player Ko Yong Ha supposedly insulted Sai's former student, Hon'inbo Shusaku, Hikaru wants to put him in his place. However, Ko Yong Ha is the top Korean player, which means Akira Toya is the one slotted to face him. Hikaru asks Kurabata to let him play in first position instead, and Kurabata says he'll decide after he sees the results of the Japan-China game. \\n So, this volume shows the games between the Japanese and Chinese players. Hikaru's game against Wang Shizhen is of course where all the drama is, and for most of the game, Hikaru is getting pushed around the board. In the endgame, after all the observers have pretty much written him off, Hikaru begins to channel his inner Sai and mounts an impress attempt at a comeback. \\n This was reminiscent of earlier volumes with high-stakes games, and leads us to the final volume, with Japan's game against Korea. Although there was nothing really new here - I think the series has just about played itself out, which is why it's good that it's nearing its end - it still brought back a little of that go magic, and there were parts of the game where I could actually look at the board and figure out what was going on.\", 'osuware XD', 'good manga', 'great fun, thrilling fun', 'Full of action, comedy, romance, fantasy, and other cool but weird stuff!

And y\\'know, I gotta say I like that flip of it because so often, in our culture, we associate being Native with some kinda inherent spiritualism.

A pitch-perfect introduction.', \"So to put it simply, I don't normally give a manga series that looks like scrapped Tim Burton characters and more action than substance a rating this high. To put it specifically; Soul Eater is balls out entertaining as balls with balls on top. It's a prototypical school-fantasy series that tries to be Harry Potter and the Nightmare Before Christmas, tries cocaine, develops a split personality and decides that it's both. And I'm not trying to fanboy but Soul Eater was the perfect show to start out with as it got me into the medium of anime and manga in the first place. The characters, action, and costumes try to be as over the top and flashy as possible just for the hell of it and that's really what dragged me into it. The show has three main teams of characters; two pairs and one threesome, a bunch of villains, and a ton of supporting characters, that each have their own abilities and personalities. The author takes characters from anywhere and everywhere in regards to halloween stereotypes; Death, witches, Mary Shelley wannabes and after skepticism, I found that making this halloween world actually works. The first three episodes introduce the main teams and setting, and then treats the building blocks of the show like clay and does whatever it wants, adding new characters, villains, settings, trials, tribulations, plot elements and powers, and the plot still manages to chug along at a strangely consistent pace. The dialogue throughout is pretty heartfelt but many times painfully corny in addition to the fact that there's a lot of fun humor in the series(or rather any time Excalibur is around, even if the wonderful stories about him were in the manga not much is told about him). Despite there being a huge cast of characters, some of the main characters and antagonists don't even interact with each other and could care less about them because they were just there to fight each other, leaving some of the pivotal parts of the series as action fodder that only looks cool but isn't relevant. Plus if you're looking for a deep manga don't read Soul Eater, it's able to play with the emotions but it's fairly shallow and not thought provoking whatsoever. I wanted to see it as a series that comments on being free from death makes one mad with power but even that shows how far I'm stretching for at least some substance to the comic. The characters are good if not very deep, but the plot is a little wonky. The setting is most of all what confused me. There's a world that features London but also has bizarre areas like the DWMA, and I wanted to know more about why they have the students do all this in the first place. Why are they learning? I'll never know. I also have seen the show twice, and what I noticed most about the manga was they toned down the so called offensive content in the show. The manga boasts way more panty shots, blood flying from orifices and aerial expletives, which I don't understand why the cut it out of the show. However when I want to sit down and read, I want to think critically whereas on TV I can just be spoonfed, so overall given the carefree artistic aspect of Soul Eater, it works better as an anime.\", \"This was a great installment to the series, however I don't think it worked as an ending. It was very abrupt, it need maybe a few more pages to really tie it together.\", 'Beautiful read. So I could finally finish one of the most complex, fascinating, depressing, influential stories of all time. It was strange that I did not remember that so many things happened differently than in the End of Evangelion movie. Of course I still prefer the animated version, but this is a really great addition. The artwork in the first four omnibus were okay, but in the last one: gorgeous. Well, the colored artworks are beautiful in every volume, but this is Sadamoto, so I did not expect less. ( I need his artbooks). The characters are more understandable and there are some really great and thoughtful conversations. The story is awesome and confusing. \\n Neon Genesis Evangelion is a very good series and its no surprise that the eva forums are as lively as they were almost twenty years ago.', 'Counting this because I read it in singles.', 'I got this book despite not being an artist. (I mean, I doodle in the corner of my notes when I\\'m bored in class, I paint my nails nailart style when I have enough time, and I do like to do some artsy stuffs like modular origami for example, but it doesn\\'t go further than that.) \\n But as, if I remember correctly, McCranie wrote himself in the description of his Kickstarter project for this book, it may be targeted to artists, but it can also be useful to people with any kind of big goal. That latest reason was mine to pick this book: for the part about motivation mostly. \\n Now, as I read the book entirely, I think it gives a great insight in the life of artists and their struggles, some that I didn\\'t even imagine. The drawing looks simple, but not too much (you should look at some French \"comics\" sometimes, you can\\'t help but wonder how it got published...), it has a perfect balance between simplicity and being just enough to look pro imo. \\n That being said, let\\'s talk about the part that really interested me.

I very nearly DNF this multiple times. It seems to be written in a way that is a strongarm feminist ideal where women are 100% the best and all men are evil. Later stories have a couple kinda okay men, but still primarily portrayed as really bad guys that want to kill women for their sass, keep them imprisoned and ignorant. \\n The art was also really ugly. The book production itself was really nice with thick pages and a solid hard cover. The illustrations are just bad in nearly every way. The coloring is sometimes mediocre, but still not good. The lettering is semi-cursive, frequently white on black, semi-hard to read. \\n I would have DNF if it was any longer than it was.

This is an extremely satisfying series. I admit the earlier volumes were a bit dicey in places but this nonstop ride of a volume ends nicely. The coolest thing about this series will probably be its impact on Gotham and the DC universe. Batman's army has gotten bigger. At the end of this series we now have Red Robin, Batgirl, Batwoman, Batwing, The Spectre, Red Hood, Bluebird, Spoiler, Catwoman the queen of gotham crime and Alfred's daughter Julia joining Batman's every growing list of allies. But I think that is the key to the story DC comics writers are telling here. Batman is eternal not because of who is in the cowl but ideal of who he represents. One man can make a difference and this one man has inspired so many to take up his mantle. As a fan that is what I feel about Batman. Anyone of his allies could be worthy to be Batman. I really enjoyed the ending to this story and was very surprised in the end to find out who was pulling the strings of all the chaos let loose on Gotham city. I do have to stress that this story can only be clearly understood if you read all the volumes. This was a great treat for all the fans and I am glad we got to touch all the different faucets of the Batman universe.\", 'Absolutely amazing!!!!', 'My actual rating is 3.5 stars. \\n The gang starts the research into why new vampires have a new power and it leads Xander to visit and old \"friend\".

The main character is incredibly annoying; I kept hoping she would get more likeable, but she hasn't. I just couldn't connect with her. And I had hoped by the third book, we would have seen more of Matt (besides dream encounters and such). \\n Sadly, this is the last published book in the series. Apparently, the original publisher CrossGen went bankrupt, and what with one thing and another the series was abandoned. I enjoyed the graphic novel part of the book much more than the straight text. It was kind of distracting that they had both; I wish they had simply made the entire series in graphic novel form only. Sad that the series didn't live up to its original promise.\", \"** spoiler alert ** \\n The first two standalone issues included in this collection are fairly terrible, but the multi-part arc pretty much makes the whole thing worth it (even if Dawn does reject the Surfer a bit too quickly).

On top of that, there is evidence indicating he may not be of royal birth. If he is not Ozai's son, then everything he and the Gaang has worked for could be for naught. \\n This book seems to meander a little more than the first, but that might also be because I haven't read the third book yet, and so I don't know how relevant some of the stuff in this book to the overall goal of the Gaang. However, even with the meandering, it still is good, and better than The Promise trilogy. \\n I love the sibling thing that is going on, in showing how important siblings are without being too in your face about it. It sets an almost hopeful mood for Zuko and Azula, hinting that maybe they can work something out. I certainly don't expect them to be best buds or anything, but I'm glad Azula is getting a second chance of sorts. Not that I felt as if she was tossed aside at the very end of the show, but I've seen so many fanfictions/fanarts of people wanting more for her character, and this book offers it in a way that makes me love Azula all the more, instead of just being throwaway fanservice. \\n Also, that bit surrounding Ursa's disappearance... Beautifully done. The expansion of that time period weaved perfectly into the scenes we had seen in the show itself, the book even using some of the lines/images from the show. \\n I had never really decided my headcanon for why Ursa left instead of Zuko, but this book's fit into some of my more favorite fan interpretations. It just made Ursa into that much more complex of a character, and I could really feel her pain, and all of the different ways she had been torn. It was the art that really captured the emotions, more than the writing. \\n While not as good as the first book, I still loved this second installment, and I can't wait to get my hands on the third. This book didn't have as much of a cliffhanger as the last (at least, I didn't feel like it was), but this next book is supposed to finally reveal the mystery of what happened to Ursa, and that's something I've been waiting years for--it's all the reason I need to pick up the next book.\", 'This series is so fantastic.', 'Los astros no han ganado nada con mi presencia aqui y su gloria no aumentara cuando yo desaparezca y nadie ha podido decirme nunca por que me han hecho venir y por que me haran partir \\n Parece que la familia Satrapi es una fuente inacabable de historias pero mientras sigan siendo tan interesantes como esta que no paren de llegar.

Lunella is a 9-year-old science whiz who's terrified of turning Inhuman. She carries the genes and the incoming Terrigen mist could turn her in an instant. For more reference for that, you'd have to read some of the other Marvel comics. It's a whole thing. \\n Lunella can't stand school because she's smarter than all of that. Plus, she's a bit awkward. She's more the type to stand around with her hands in her pockets during gym class. Her inventions are clever, but also get her in trouble. She comes across a Kree device that was previously owned during the prehistoric era and somehow that sends a red T-Rex and a pack of killer cavemen (and cavewomen!) to earth. Just go with it. Lunella and the Devil Dinosaur team up and even face off with The Hulk at one point. The whole thing is a bit madcap, but kids will embrace this gladly. \\n The representation of Lunella, who's a nerdy African American kid, is so important. Seriously, one bajillion stars for that alone. I almost wish she was a bit older--9 seems a little young for the way she acts--but I'm looking forward to watching Lunella Lafayette grow up in the Marvel universe.\", 'This was a really fun comic, the writing captured the characters perfectly and the dynamic between them was really enjoyable to read.

The bit with Truska was also really sweet. The moment when Darren finally caves to his feelings of loss for Lartin was really moving and brought a tear to my eye. \\n It was interesting to see how Arai interpreted the other/future world. The leopard that he drew was huge and very viscous looking, which even though that is how it is described in the novel, I always imagine it as looking just like an ordinary leopard but bigger. I liked the dragons and the temple creature was brilliantly grotesque. The 'Kulashkas' were weird but good, whereas Spits was just horrid. I really liked the way that Kurda was presented in this manga. I think that he looked much nicer than in the previous volumes. He seems really kind and somehow weary. \\n I noticed that there is a least one extra clue in the manga as to Harkat's identity before it is revealed. On the front cover of the volume Arai has added three scars to Harkat's face which is a vampeneze symbol of which Kurda was the only vampire to have. \\n This was a good adaption of the novel and receives three stars.\", \"Though this book is heavily factual, I also found it very moving for its look at peoples' hope for the future over the decades.

Yes, Hawkeye worked, but here the variables are entirely different. Vision is a synthezoid, and probably everyone\\'s least favourite. \\n King\\'s take on Vision reminded me of Gaiman\\'s Black Orchid run, reinventing a not so mainstream character, by embracing the original handicaps with fresh perspectives. I read a little deep into fan letters and found these words of King himself \"For me, Vision is the chance to explore the alienation that sometimes attract people to comics, the tension that comes from not being normal in a society that demands normality\". This summarizes the series so perfectly, comic is still a misfits medium, despite the cameo popularity during major movie releases. Vision maybe an Avenger, who has saved the world multiple times; but he is always an outsider to societal standards, and is forced to make do with that. \\n Vision felt less Marvel and more Vertigo or Image in execution. Virginia\\'s mental struggle to balance morality and motherhood, Viv and Vin\\'s longing for acceptance in normalcy and image of Vision torn between his identity, loyalty and family are going to stay with me for a long while. \\n The story had a running monologue in flashback, though the panels moved in real time. This monologue in initial issues were illustrated in \\'purple\\' boxes with creativity and affection. Towards the final issues the independence represented by \\'purple\\' colour gave way to aggressiveness of \\'red\\'. This synesthetic approach managed to maintain a whole universe with its intricacies in background, which could have easily overshadowed the former narrative. I adored the pace, and cross tie in elements and throw backs. Though introduced via Agatha\\'s prophecy the disturbing Wanda storyline from golden ages formed a strong physiological backing here, and it was devastatingly beautiful. \\n To conclude things with brevity, King\\'s miniseries is more than just paranoid people making androids paranoid.

(Just the sheer idea of it is giving most of geekdom multiple nerdgasms.) However, since he's the one who likes to claim that this run of Buffy comics are the actual continuation of the story after the TV series ended, you'd think the Joss-man would have cleared his calendar enough to write a critical piece to this so-called 'Season 8' arc of Buffy. \\n Instead, he handed over the reins to Brad Metzler, who does an OK job, but the story probably would have been better served if The Man himself would have taken the time to do it himself, just as he usually wrote and directed the big episodes of his various TV shows. \\n Following the monumentally stupid decision Buffy and her gang made in the last volume Retreat to try and magically hide all the Slayers by voluntarily giving up their powers, the ensuing battle has left Buffy's little army in bad shape. However, Buffy suddenly starts becoming more powerful and displays a Superman-like array of abilities. As Willow tries to track down the friends who have gone missing following the latest attack, the final showdown with the mysterious figure called Twilight (hee) occurs and his identity is revealed. \\n Oh, and in a trivial note, Whedon finally got the comic rights for Angel back and the brooding vampire and Buffy are reunited. I doubt any of the Buffy fans will care about that.... \\n I've had mixed feelings about these Buffy comics. While I love the idea of Whedon continuing the official story, since he's no longer constrained by the budget provided by a minor TV network, he and the other writers have gone a bit overboard with the big sci-fi concepts. The comic has been at it's best when it's focused on the characters and the smaller scale stories. When they do trippy stuff like time-travel or alternate dimensions, it hasn't been particularly well-explained and has been confusing at times. This volume has a lot of that kind of stuff, so I just didn't enjoy it all that much. Even the return of Angel got wrapped up in a bunch of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo that left me scratching my head and wondering what he hell just happened. Whatever happened to the old Buffy-fights-vampire-Buffy-stakes-vampire-while-dealing-with-her-responsibilities-and-fear stories? \\n Plus, the artwork seems a little on the cartoony side for what should be a more serious and scary story featuring vampires and demons. \\n Still nice to read the continuing adventures of Buffy and her friends, but I'd like it more if they'd return to the basics and use the 'real world' as a setting more than they have been.\", \"So sad.

In this graphic novel Snow White is the 2nd in command of the community of Fabletown and the big kahuna is King Cole. \\n I liked the mystery in this graphic novel.

My knowledge of Toriyama\\'s work begins and ends with Dragon Ball so seeing his older characters may be exciting for fans of Dr Slump but not for me. \\n And though Dragon Ball\\'s not exactly an edgy series - it\\'s child-friendly for the most part - compared to Dr Slump, it\\'s like a Garth Ennis book! The characters in Dr Slump are just soooo cutesy-wutesy, from the floating genius baby who can telepathically make machines, to the little happy power girl, and the twins wearing animal hats who are also super-super-upbeat about everything; eesh, it\\'s so sickeningly sweet! \\n But there are lots of great Goku moments throughout, especially when he\\'s fighting Blue and a rat inadvertently gives him an opening that allows him to momentarily beat him. When the cave starts to fall in, he saves the rat because the rat saved him - that\\'s how good-hearted a person he is. \\n And the \"Superman\" parody scene was brilliant too - seeing the little \"Clark Kent\" character dash off into a conveniently placed phone box to change into Suppa-Man was so funny. \\n Volume 7 is definitely the weakest addition to the series so far, but with the Dr Slump fan service/back-patting (hopefully) over and done with, things can only get better here on out as Goku continues his quest to get his grandpa\\'s four-star dragon ball before the Red Ribbon Army.', 'Non, ils ne se ressemblent pas comme deux bouteilles de Whisky! \\n Das ist ein interessanter Blick in die Vergangenheit fur mich, der Lucky Luke nur in seiner Endausbaustufe kannte.

There is a curious lack of suspense and incidents in the narrative. However, it's a unique addition to the collection.\", \"This book collects Issues 90-113 of the Amazing Spider-man and is notable for being the last issues of Stan Lee's incredible run with most of the book by Lee (90-100, 105-110) with the other 1/4 being by Roy Thomas (101-104) and Gerry Conway (111-113) \\n Volume 4 had ended with the return of Doctor Octopus and Issue 90 picks that up with Peter continuing to fight Doctor Octopus but in Issue 90, Captain George Stacy gives his life saving a child endangered in the crossfire. The death of Captain Stacy was a benchmark in the Spider-man universe with great consequences. It had been hinted that Stacy knew of Peter's true identity and in Issue 90, Captain Stacy actually confirms that's the case. \\n Peter Parker was in love with Gwen Stacy, who blamed Spider-man for the death of her father. The incident was used by a corrupt candidate for District Attorney to further his own campaign (91-92) and media cover led X-men charter member Iceman to attack. Issue 93 had Spider-man attacked by the Prowler leaving Peter unable to get to Gwen in time. Issue 94 saw Peter ready to hang up the Webs until the Beetle makes a big mistake. Issue 95 has Peter going to London and try and speak to Gwen but Spider-man has a supervillain he has to fight. \\n This mini-arch around the Death of Captain Stacy was superb, leading to some very good stories where Peter Parker's emotions and conflicts are portrayed realistically and great humanity. I loved Spidey in London. \\n Issues 96-98 were another landmark in the series featuring the return of Green Goblin, but also Peter discovering that his best friend and roommate Harry Osborn had a drug problem. The last two issues were printed without Comic Book Code approval and was a true landmark with Lee discussing a vitally important issue in a way that was not too preachy and also very human with Peter Parker getting into action against a band of drug dealers. \\n At the end of that arch, Gwen Stacy returned and the two are quite a couple. Issue #99 was more forgettable with its focus on prison reform which seemed less like Spidey. Issue 100 was a great retrospective on Spidey with Peter deciding to quit being Spider-man and take a concoction that he thinks will cure him of his Spider-powers. Instead, it gives him six arms. This issue is hard to hate because the six-arms thing is so iconic though Spidey deciding to quit comes out of nowhere because he's with his girlfriend, he's got a job staff photographer, and his problems are limited. \\n This leads into Roy Thomas' mini-run. Issues 101 an 102 resolve the six arms issue while also introducing Morbius the Vammpire who ends up fighting the Lizard. Issues 103 and 104 has J Jonah Jameson responding to fall circulation numbers by taking Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy (in a bikini) to the Savage Lands, where they meet Ka-Zar who ends up fighting Kraven the Hunter and a creature named Zog. \\n Thomas is a good writer and these are fun stories. However Thomas' weakness (particulary in the second arch) is that he seems to forget, this is supposed to be the magazine about Spider-man as Spidey becomes an after thought in his own magazine. \\n Issues 105-107 feature the return of the Spider Slayers, a story arch that causes some reviewers to roll their eyes as it was the third appearance of Professor Spencer Smythe and his robots. I liked the arch because the robots are far more menacing than the silly things that showed up back in Amazing Spider-man #25. Plus there are additional elements that are nice to see such as Smythe using anti-crime big brother cameras that he'd been contracted by the city to install and service to commit crimes. Issues 108 and 109 are a story about Flash being haunted for something that occurred in Vietnam and it's a memorable serial that has a good reason for featuring a cameo by Doctor Strange. \\n Also in Issue 109, Gwen Stacy finally tells Aunt May that she's been babying Peter too much and acting like he's an infant. May reacts like a mature elderly woman would: she runs away from home. \\n Issue 110 is unfortunate in that it's Stan Lee's last issue and it introduces the weak character of the Gibbon, a hair guy who was such a fan of Spider-man that he wanted to be Spidey's sidekick. Spidey blows him off while searching for Aunt May leading to him to become a villain. \\n This is consummated in Issue 111 under the tutelage of an A-list Spidey villain who had been thought dead. Unfortunately, both the villain's return and Conway's first issue were wasted by his plot. \\n Issue 112 sees Spidey running away from fighting crime so he can find Aunt May, and the newspaper labels Spidey as a coward which hails back to Issues 15 and 16 of the story and feels kind of tired but ends on an upswing as Spidey ends the book where he began it: forced to confront Doctor Octopus. \\n Despite the last few issues, most of these stories stand up pretty well with the Death of Captain Stacy, the Return of the Green Goblin (with Anti-drug message), and Stan Lee's last spider-slayer story being strong highlights. Conway's issues are a bit of a tease as we begin to get an idea of what his era (which would reshape Spider-man) would be like. It's telling that these last three issues feature very little of Gwen showing from the beginning struggled with what to do with the character. He would decide what to do with the character in the next Essential.\", \"This part was supposed to be the best, but I didn't like it all that much, sadly.\", 'Begining \\n In this book Bella finds out that Edward is a Vampire!

The teen protagonists, denizens in a nameless suburb where adults seem few and far between, are disaffected and angst-ridden, desperate to connect and yet unwilling to admit just how lost they feel. A new venereal disease has begun to spread among the sexually curious and adventurous youth, causing body deformities and mutations to take place, a metaphor of the internal inferiority and ugliness that the young feel made outwardly manifest. Most of the kids try to hide these changes, and when that isn't possible, they remove themselves from the social fabric and congregate as a group of misfits out in the woods. Burns's story is a classic reinvention of the archetypal tale of alienated youth, the subtext of so many novels from Catcher in the Rye to The Fault in Their Stars made text as the monster within erupts. Both horrifying and intensely beautiful, Black Hole tells the story of a group of humans, desperate to hide their individuality, in those years before they can grasp and comprehend the value of their unique and uncategorizable selves.\", \"Confusing.

When Spirou and Fantasio arrive to visit they discover that the Count has developed an amazing new technology from a rare mushroom that turns rigid metal into something soft and spongey. Ever curious, the Marsupilami gets ahold of it and to everyone's horror runs amok in the nearby town softening everything from bicycles to drain covers. It's agreed that it's now or never to re-home the Marsupilami, so Spirou and Fantasio's first stop is the zoo where he once resided. However, the zoo has fallen on hard times and has had to close, but a chance meeting with tits director encourages them to bite the bullet and return their arboreal friend to Palombia. \\n After a difficult journey they arrive in the country only to find a heavy military presence. The country is under the control of a new leader, and it's someone the two friends have come across before, so Spirou and Fantasio are forced to compromise their convictions to stand a chance of ever leaving the country again. Fortunately they have help, and the hope that word can get to the Count so they can utilise his latest invention. \\n I love the way Cinebook are now alternating the newer and older adventures of Spirou and Fantasio, meaning we get the best of both worlds. This book, by the master cartoonist Franquin, is crispy fresh and just as funny as when it first saw print sixty years ago, and I'm particularly pleased that we're getting more Marsupilami into the bargain. Franquin's story switches from madcap chases to comic peril, allowing him to show his cartooning off to best effect. \\n There's been very little opportunity to read an English translation so I highly recommend you grab these with both hands and devour them with relish.\", 'Overall, I liked the new take on the story and the artwork (especially compared to Ultimates 3).

I knew going into it that this particular graphic novel causes some controversy and I wanted to read it to know why or make my own decisions. \\n Maus is the story of a survivor of the Holocaust as told to his son through an extended interview. The book depicts the Jewish as mice, the Polish as pigs, and the Germans as Cats and goes back and forth between a current timeline and what was happening to Vladek (the survivor) during his experiences with the Nazis. \\n This first installment is really a build up. Artie starts talking to his father about his history and this leads to the overall tale. Vladek in this book is talking about the beginning, being in the war, coming home, having things taken, people going missing, and the events leading up to his stay in Auschwitz. Although, readers don't start to hear the tales of the camps until the 2nd book. \\n I have to admit that this book is very deep, it is an emotional journey regardless of if it is fiction or non-fiction. Tales of the Holocaust are always emotional. It too was very sad that the author chose to depict the characters as animals - I think that these choices say a lot about how each of the groups were portrayed and I feel there was some insensitivity to those groups. Everyone in Europe was affected by the Holocaust and I think this tale is taking a very complex social dynamic and trying to fit it in a box... 'the cats were bad, the poles were no better'... and there were some that did not stand for the injustices committed. \\n I think that this is an important piece of graphic novel evolution/ canon - it is a strong message, an emotional event, and I think that Spiegelman wrote it to be as deep as it is.

Although her three older brothers also attend the same school, they are not much help since they have their own classes and social circles. Maggie is on her own--except for the ghost that keeps following her and seems to be growing more and more persistent. Since she has spent most of her formative years hanging out with her brothers, she\\'s had little experience in being friends with females. Eventually, Maggie finds her way around school--she draws a map that helps her get to class quickly and avoid certain areas where students make out or sleep--and even ends up hanging out with two loners, siblings Lucy and Alistair. In their own ways, they are outcasts at the school, but it\\'s clear that there is some mystery concerning the rift between the Mohawk-wearing Alistair and volleyball star Matt. When Alistair finally tells Maggie the story behind his haircut, prefacing his revelation with the statement, \"It\\'s easy to lose your soul in high school\" (unpaginated), it\\'s easy to feel his pain and his shame as well for not being brave enough to stand up for his sister or for the others such as Maggie\\'s brother Daniel, ridiculed for his interest in drama rather than sports. Maggie is such a sweetheart that it\\'s impossible not to like her and to ponder her fate in the sometimes-cruel high school social order. While Daniel finds his place on the stage, starring in Last of the Zombies: A Musical Extravaganza, and his character is more fully fleshed out than Maggie\\'s twin brothers, Lloyd and Zander, they, too, struggle with identity issues, searching for individuality while often being lumped together because they are twins.

Oh, those were two words, but well it's an amazing shoujo manga. It starts with an absolutely unpopular girl and a popular boy falling in love with each other. Well, their relationship didn't really start that smooth, both of them kind of hated each other in the beginning, they did have their reasons. Everything does start with a quite bad start, but very soon both of them find themselves deeply in love with each other. But will their love be enough to overcome what is waiting for them in the future? That's up to you to find out. \\n The characters are amazing, especially their development. Both Tsubaki and Kyouta have a long way to go. And all their feelings are shown in this manga; their fears and their joys, their love and also their sorrow. The manga covers a really huge part of their lives. One of the best parts is when they break up so Tsubaki can find what she wants to do in the future. Manga focuses quite excessively on the future and that not all of us know what we want to do, as well as that we should follow our dreams, and we should fight for them and even stand up to our parents to make them understand that it is our lives, not theirs. \\n Now let me just explain one thing before I finish up here. This is something with their names. You might have a problem getting why they are called every time differently. In Japan using a person's first name means you are very close to this somebody, so it is common that in mangas sometimes people call each other by their family names. So now back to my explanation. The heroine's name is Tsubaki Shibano, while the hero's name is Kyouta Tsubaki. Meaning Tsubaki for a girl is first name, while for a boy a surname. Hope, you will not be confused after reading this. \\n You will enjoy this manga a lot. It has everything. A lot of love, but quite a big portion of heartbreak too, nice humor and a lot of every day life problems. The characters are amazing. They impress you from the very first page and you don't really want to put the manga down until you finish it. I hope you enjoy it to its fullest\", \"This is the second time Locke & Key made me burn dinner. \\n I just can't help it, I get so caught up in the world of Lovecraft, that nothing else matters. \\n It just keeps on getting better and better, leaving the reader wanting more and more.

I AM ADDICTED!\", 'Ever since Vice started publishing Schubert\\'s Blobby Boys comics, I\\'ve really been into them. But if you asked me why, I couldn\\'t really say. So it was nice to read Vice comics editor Nick Gazin\\'s introduction to this book, which I think hits it on the nose: \\n Alex Schubert is one of my favorite new-ish cartoonists. There are things about his drawings that remind me of Gary Panter, like his poses and sometimes his lines, when he employs a ratty Panter line. There are things in his work that remind me of Clowes, particularly how everything in his panels is so clean, clear and intentional. I also similarities to Johnny Ryan in that he deals in characters who are fun loving misanthropes up to no good. Although his work reminds me of all of these great cartoonists his work doesn\\'t feel referential to them. His work references almost nothing we\\'ve known before. I mentioned that he shares Clowes\\'s intentionality. He creates everything he draws without referencing other people\\'s lexicon of pictographic shorthand. \\n For instance, in the \"Cyber Surfer\" comic he drew for me, me being me and the Vice website for which I serve as Comics Editor, the comic starts off with a few borderless panels of a stiffly drawn character. He then punches someones brains out and the way his brains comes out of his head is done in an entirely new way to me. Sure, he uses the cartoon cloud bubble but the way it\\'s portrayed is new. A few panels down from that he spies a trenchcoat and fedora lying on the ground. The way the coat is drawn is something I\\'ve never seen done before. He is making his own visual abbrevs. \\n Also, he is very funny and I love when his characters speak to each other. I realize now that I should have asked him to feature more of that in the comics he\\'s done for me/Vice. I think every comic he\\'s done for me has featured an isolated character talking to the reader. The sequence in the Blobby Boys comic book in which one of them oozes under a door to ask the inhabitant of the room if he wants to buy some drugs and the guy inside answers firmly but unsurprised, \"No, who are you\" kills me. So that\\'s why I like Alex\\'s work. I think he\\'s unpretentious, funny and his drawings are both good and original. \\n P.S. Schubert\\'s other comic for Vice, Fashion Cat, is good too!', \"This contemporary, fresh miniseries defined Marvel's mightiest team as it would appear in a newer, more cynical, more realistic world.\", \"The first part of this volume is finishing up the aftermath of the last arc, and if there was any doubt before that Fairy Tail is an awesome guild to be part of, the end of that arc dispels them.

England seems Victorian, but computers get used as descriptions so it's not quite the same. Her becoming an apprentice somehow upset the way the neighborhood was going and to make it up they get sent out to fix some magical problems (again just going with it, it's not the strangest thing I've been asked to accept from a manga story). \\n It's strange but I really enjoyed reading it and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.\", 'This book by one of the original creators is amazing.

Rather, this is the story where Prof X and Mags \"eloped\" to Genosha so they can re-establish its sovereignty and civilization once again. They are joined by Callisto and a delightful gang of teenage mutants and a couple of idealists who want to make a difference. \\n But because this is the X-Men and Claremont we are talking about, such a nice premise is misleading and deceptive. And because this is Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr we\\'re talking about, of course the issues are bound to get crazy, cheesy, emotastic and kindda-sorta homoerotic depending on how you interpret some scenes. \\n Known as Volume III, this version of Excalibur is something I\\'ve been dying to read because its basically a love letter to the fans of the ever-enduring core relationship between the aforementioned bookend-soulmates. The four-issued story arc Forging the Sword is collected in this first volume which feature tremendous amount of Cherik scenes that make my shipper heart suffocate in the syrupy thickness of my disastrous obsession for these two dorks. \\n Allow me to state this once again: \\n Cherik is the oxygen, drugs and food that sustain my saddest nights on this planet and I will inhale, snort and devour it any goddamn chance I get. \\n In Excalibur III, Genosha has been decimated horrendously and it\\'s presently in utter shambles while its mutant citizenry is clamoring for survival, searching for a leader to govern them. Unfortunately, Unus the Untouchable appointed himself as that. There was also a Magneto imposter walking around for a while, causing havoc in New York. This first issue, Paint It Black, opens with Charles Xavier soliloquising about his decision to leave the X-Men behind so he can go to Genosha, knowing they will survive without him anyway. Now Charles runs away to Genosha and takes the corpse of the poser-Magneto with him so he can meet up with the real Erik who apparently faked his own death and has been hiding from the world since. \\n I suppose they\\'re both in Genosha to make amends with its people because they are considered the leaders of the mutant revolution no matter how much their views and methods clash. It\\'s therefore a personal failure and injury to see such a civilization like Genosha become a wasteland because they were unable to save it. Now they feel obliged to fix that mistake together. So--if you think about it--they\\'re keeping this all in clandestine mode, so neither the X-Men nor the Brotherhood know their whereabouts. \\n BECAUSE THEY FUCKING ELOPED, OKAY? \\n You see, Charles Xavier and Erik (Magnus) Lehnsherr never had what any of us might call a \\'conventional\\' relationship. Their mutual understanding from the beginning becomes a rather complicated rivalry in the next decades to follow where they constantly find themselves fighting on the opposite sides of a war neither of them would compromise for--not even for the sake of salvaging their friendship. It seemed at first--from the moment they realized they were both mutants--that their first meeting was destined to happen; only to ultimately lose each other in the long run once it became clear that their ideologies would keep on clashing when it came to establishing and fighting for mutant rights. That was the deal breaker that prevented them from joining their forces and building a future. \\n The second issue of Excalibur III is entitled With A Little Help From My Friends gives us the opportunity to read a lengthy heart-to-heart discussion between Charles and Erik. I\\'m so deliriously happy that Erik has opened to Charles so readily in just a span of pages for this second issue. To reveal his vulnerability (his hopes and insecurities) like this just shows how far Erik has fallen and how much he intends to pick himself up and change for the better and with the help of the one person who will never fail him. \"The past cannot be changed\" is true, and that much applies to their relationship as well. Long ago when they have chosen sides, it was also by fighting against each other. There is an ocean of violence between them since and now it\\'s time to do things differently--to establish a new mutant community in Genosha together--and that\\'s the whole reason why they\\'re there now. Look, I know I kept joking about them running away to elope because they\\'re so in love since I started reviewing this series, but you know what? \\n WHY CAN\\'T IT BE BOTH ANYWAY? \\n Why can\\'t Charles and Erik be in love all this time so they eloped AND also choose Genosha to start a future together because it\\'s the place that they know they can restore and protect because its citizens need two outstanding leaders to whip it back into shape? These two men have shared a connection that continued to exist even in their darkest moments. Their trust and intuitive understanding of one another\\'s faults and desires had made them seek each other throughout the years even when it is impossible to work out a compromise where their separate ideals can benefit from. And after decades of trials and errors, they finally arrived in the same page. \\n How can you not be moved to tears as I am, you cold-hearted non-shipper?! \\n The third and fourth issue continue the tradition of Charles and Erik caught up in so much drama whilst still finding ways to open up to each other, trying to be totes BFFs again while ignoring the electricity of unrequited love and unconsummated sexual tension between them. Here are some of the highlights of the first volume of this series that threaten to obliterate my ovaries. \\n These include Cherik having a meal during sunset and Charles checking out his \\'body\\': \\n Charles complimenting Erik\\'s culinary skills because he just prepared said meal earlier for Charles: \\n Erik not giving a fuck what people think about his relationship with Charles: \\n Other fun-filled honeymoon-ing activities such as Cherik scuba-diving: \\n Erik losing his shit because of the smallest things such as Charles mentioning his ex, Moira, which made Erik rather possessive: \\n And we also have Cherik confessing how much they need each other and how much they want their marriage to work this time: \\n These are just some of the gems you can find for this volume. In summary, Professor X and Magneto may be arch-nemesis for decades but Charles and Erik clearly belong together now and forever and Claremont\\'s series proves that once and for all. \\n It\\'s what\\'s written in the stars. \\n Now here be the blurbs with links to individual issue reviews: \\n ISSUE #1 \\n --> In which Charles hallucinates Moira with quite the cleavage, Unus is a jerkwad, and Erik wears the world\\'s dorkiest orange sweater. \\n ISSUE #2 \\n --> In which Cherik have their first date, talk about their feelings and regrets, and get sorely interrupted with the appearance of Callisto who complains about the make-up-break-up-make-up arrangement between Charles and Erik that is seriously starting to piss off everyone \\n ISSUE #3 \\n --> In which Cherik spent some time underwater to locate a mysterious coffin while everyone on ground are fighting the bad guys \\n ISSUE #4 \\n --> In which Charles and Erik once again prove they are better united than apart and where they confessed how the survival of Genosha and the survival of their relationship depend on compromise and cooperation this time around. \\n RECOMMENDED: 8/10 \\n DO READ MY REVIEWS AT', \"I can't stand Anne. ~_~ Too Mary Sue-ish for me.\", 'Just when you think you have things figured out and people might be starting to settle down ...

He has really come onto Swamp Thing and done a magnificent job writing the adventures for the human that is a monster. Or is it the monster that thinks it is human. Volume 6 collects some of the best issues I have ever read so far since Charles Soule started writing. What have always enjoyed about the Swamp Thing stories is that Alec Holland is a creature trying hard to hold on to his humanity. I can imagine that one would be quite lonely if you had to respond to every threat plant life encounters 24/7 and you are this moss covered monster. It is hard to forget that this is a superhero book. Mr. Soule just sweeps you into the story. In this story Holland is presented with the opportunity to inhabit a human host body temporarily to ease his constant strain of being the walking vegetation monster. All appears well until he discovers that the human who offered this transformation have alternative motives. Not to mention he is responsible for protecting the immortal warrior woman, Capucine and some rather devious former Swamp things. Things spiral out of control and Holland must find his Swamp thing body before things get dangerous for him and the world of the Green. The second have of the book Swamp Thing is confronted with an out of control algae that is spreading in the ocean which brings him face to face with Aquaman. So their is so much here for the comic book reader. The artist have really created a beautifully looking book. It is an easily accessible for the first time reader and it is a little stranger than you average superhero fare.

So, understandably enough, my fangirl heart was ever pleased to peruse through this issue, and there are many great things I enjoyed about this comic--and a few nitpicks that I\\'ll just get out of the way real quick because I can wholeheartedly say that the good has outweighed the bad in this continuing saga of Zero Year, and this time we enter the first installment of the Savage City arc, which is also the last arc of ZY. \\n I take my Batman very seriously especially with New 52, a continuity that is still rather shaky in some of its crucial landings for the most part (I\\'m honestly getting tested with some other titles, like JLA, Teen Titans and Action Comics, which are mixed bags of awesomeness and weird shit), but I\\'m quite happy, nay, even proud to say that Scott Synder\\'s Batman run is one of the DC titles of the new continuity that is trying to be consistent and excellent in every creative decision made. Now I know there are two to three more issues to go but I can already say that Zero Year is my most favorite saga from Snyder\\'s run. \\n Issue #30, Savage City part I opens up with a dream sequence from Bruce Wayne. He wakes up from that and finds himself in an almost fairy tale-esque setting: Gotham City is presently infested with shrubbery and forestry (thanks to Pamela Isley\\'s plant formula which the Riddler stole) while its despondent citizenry haplessly shuffle through their lives, waiting for a hero who has only woken up, and one who is still unsure how to undo the terrible \\'curse\\' that intellectual narcissist Edward Nygma has cast. Looking through the illustrations, my mind just started having nostalgic recollections of Sleeping Beauty and it certainly fits the atmospheric tone and mood of the entire issue. \\n This is the foremost reason the storytelling itself spoke to me resonantly. I love a murky setting which most fairy tales have, especially when there\\'s the general good and evil forces thrown into the mix. Nygma as the Riddler is a pompous, self-serving man who claims to have the higher ground by challenging the city to \\'get smart or die\\', taunting them to one-up him through a sick game of riddles. So far, no one has defeated him in this mental battle and this is definitely the side of the Riddler than I can get into because Edward Nygma had always believed he is intellectually gifted and it distraught him to be surrounded by lesser minds. This riddle game of his is also his way to show off and make people around him inferior which definitely strokes that bombastic ego of his. \\n The expanse of the artwork and illustrations by Capullo, Miki and FCO are (and I cannot stress this any more than I already have since the beginning of Zero Year) is sheer perfection; the attention to detail and coloring are staggering. Each page is just so full of lush; even the grittier action sequences look pretty. \\n Now for my nitpicks: it\\'s rather simple, really. WHAT THE HELL HAS ALFRED BEEN DOING WHILE BRUCE WAYNE/BATMAN IS BELIEVED TO BE DEAD? I refuse to believe that all he did was sit on the bat-cave, just waiting. Alfred is such a vital character in Batman\\'s rich history, and I wish Snyder gave him a more important role in this issue in light of Bruce\\'s absence. I could totally picture him taking the reigns, picking up on where Batman left off because he is equipped with military weapons at his disposal in the bat-cave anyway so why the hell not won\\'t he keep the spirit of Batman alive? Heck, Jim Gordon is running around, trying to figure out a way to get the citizens free out of Gotham. So why is Alfred just sitting around there? He\\'s no feeble old man. He\\'s always had more teeth than most butlers in the fictional universe of comics. \\n That\\'s a missed opportunity there, Mr. Snyder. If Alfred took the cowl for himself temporarily, this may lead to him understanding why Batman is relevant to Gotham. He may be more inclined to finally accept Bruce\\'s choice to become a vigilante. But nope. That\\'s not what happened. It\\'s a minuscule detail but one that could have been produced a really amazing character exposition. \\n That\\'s really my only nitpick for this issue. Other than that, the first installment of Savage City has an even brisk pace that sets up the pieces before they are maneuvered across the board for hopefully a great match of wits and endurance between Batman and the Riddler for the upcoming issues. \\n RECOMMENDED: 9/10 \\n [DO READ MORE ABOUT MY BATMAN REVIEWS IN http://batman-comics-geek.blogspot.com/]', 'Hot damn!

I don't get what they see in Archie at all. I think that's why I like this book so much because I'm excited for Archie to die. Is that mean? Am I twisted? I just find him completely annoying. Give me more Predator action! I love it!\", \"After reading Darth Vader and Son and, Vader's Little Princess, I thought it'd be cute as the other books, but it's getting meh.\", \"This book collects the five issue series from Image Comics. The story was by Jimmy Palmiotti and Garth Ennis and was written by Garth Ennis with art by Mihailo Vukelic. Hopefully Ennis requires no introduction from me as he is one of my favourite writers and I have written about him and some of his books on this blog. Jimmy Palmiotti is a writer and inker who often collaborates with Justin Gray and had a five year run on Jonah Hex. This series marked the comic book debut of Mihailo Vukelic. \\n Bob Saetta is a gangster who has turned himself over to the police and federal agents to testify against his crime lord brother, Paul, and bring down his criminal empire. However, Paul is holding Bob's wife and child and so Bob arranges with the lead investigators that he be released long enough so that he can free his family. They agree and so begins a bitter battle waged on the streets of Brooklyn between the brothers. \\n This is a pretty straight forward hard-boiled crime story from Garth Ennis. Whether it is under the influence of Palmiotti or not, the violence portrayed in the book is grim and brutal but without the underlying black humour that we expect from Ennis' own work. The reason for Bob's turning against his brother seems like a typical Ennis shocker but there are moments of the blackest humour when Bob visits his mother to talk about what Paul has been up to. The art from Vukelic is very nice but somewhat unusual too. The colouring leaves the book looking like a sepia toned document of the past and the colour palette is muted throughout. All in all a good read but I do miss the all out craziness of one of Ennis' own scripts.\", 'Oh man I really liked this manga. It is very cute and I am immediately reading the next volume.', 'This volume collects Jim Steranko\\'s runs on Nick Fury\\'s Strange Tale\\'s stories. The book begins with Strange Tales #150 and #151 Steranko began to transition into becoming the series artist and eventually writer through Issue #168 \\n The book focuses on two seperate baddies. The first half focuses on Fury\\'s battle with the Supreme Hydra. And then it\\'s on to battling the Yellow Claw, a character introduced in the mid-1950s when Marvel was known as Atlas. (Though this occurs with a twist.) Then we wrap up with an issue that foreshadows the Scorpio line that would feature in four of the five first issues of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s own comic book. \\n What you get in these 19 Nick Fury stories are standard action spy adventure stuff from the 1960s with nearly every issue ending with Fury in a deathtrap or facing some weird strangeness. At this point, the only difference between Fury and the superheroes of the Avengers is that Fury had government sanction, and no superhero costume. In fact, one of the book\\'s guest stars is Captain America and Fury fights him to a standstill in an exhibition. \\n There are also guest appearance by Mr. Fantastic, the Thing, and Dr. Doom. \\n I will admit that some of the hype around the book set me up for a bit of a disappointment. Despite all the talk about Steranko\\'s art, throughout most of the book, it wasn\\'t all that exciting, until the last three issues which also included an eye-popping four page pullout. \\n Overall, some good stories for fans of Nick Fury who remain true to the the motto, \"Don\\'t yield, back S.H.I.E.L.D.\"', \"Collects JLA #115-119. \\n This JLA story ties into the aftermath of the Identity Crisis as the Justice League must, as a unit, either come together and put the past behind them or disband for good. Meanwhile the Secret Society of Super-villains looks to pay back the JLA for messing with their minds and memories. However, the question comes up, who un-brain-washed them? And what are his ultimate goals? The answer may not surprise you -- once you release it ain't Lex Luthor -- but the resulting battle and final decisions might. The sad note is how the collection ends in a cliff-hanger that doesn't appear to relate to the story at hand and ties directly into DC's mega-crossover Infinite Crisis. \\n JLA vol. 18.\", 'The Dalton brothers repent?', 'So So.', \"While it's nice to see a graphic novel aimed at this age group that focuses on deafness, I'm not sure how many kids will love this book. It has great appeal to those wanting to know more about the subject, but it tends to focus more on the technicalities of being deaf than a storyline. The illustrations, struggles of Cece and her funny interactions with other kids make it an enjoyable read in the end.\", \"Gorgeous in every way. It took ages to read (with my basic O-level French) but that wasn't exactly a hardship - just meant I had longer to linger over those expressive, imaginative images. I love the way the colour blue of the title appears throughout as a visual cipher. So few words are needed....especially in the love scenes... Well worth having a go in the original language, heh, nan, waow!\", \"This one reads a little closer to comic book than graphic novel, and I kind of like this retro feel, bringing older readers (like me) back to this feeling of prose in panels that gave way to the graphic novels we celebrate for younger readers today. \\n This is a classic fish out of water story with a young boy who finds himself on an alien ship that doubles as an academy. While trying to find his way around the school and the alien students he encounters, Bud finds that HE is the alien. And he may be a very large threat to the school. \\n Hero's Journey extensions can be found within EARTHLING, but I am really liking this book for younger, dormant readers.\", '**3.5** \\n Powell\\'s The Goon: Nothin\\' But Misery is an entertaining enough tale of neighbourhood thug vs. zombies (and more). Through 30s and 40s pastiche, Powell creates a character who\\'s probably more bad than good by our modern standards. He runs a protection racket, buys shipments of stolen goods off the docks, and flattens anyone who doesn\\'t pay his debts on time. However, in a town where zombies roam free, ghosts hold people captive, and little green men make children into snacks, the Goon serves his purpose. He protects the regular folk from the less savory elements lurking in the shadows; from the amount of respect he\\'s shown, he must be very good at his job. \\n The stories collected in this volume are extremely episodic. There are a few running themes, such as the zombie priest, but overall any one of them could be read out of order without losing the general thread of the piece. Mostly it\\'s the Goon and his pal Franky meeting something formidable and getting knocked about a bit, then the Goon triumphing and teaching the baddie a lesson. It made for a quick read, and though I enjoyed the set-up for my introduction to the series, I hope later volumes include more details on the Goon himself and perhaps an overarching plot. I always derive more enjoyment from piecing together drawn-out mysteries as opposed to reading about the monster of the week. \\n The artwork depicts a treacherous, urban landscape that perfectly reflects the darkness the Goon battles. The areas inhabited by zombies are even worse off, as if the buildings themselves are decaying at the same pace as the undead. Powell\\'s color palette reinforces the idea of illness and death through muted tones of sickly green and broad strokes of grey. \\n When it comes to flashbacks, Powell changes his style. One transition from present to past is particularly memorable: The Buzzard\\'s background story begins in ink but quickly changes to sepia-toned pencil work, highlighting not just the difference in time period, but also the change in landscape and a switch to a more sober tone. I was impressed by the skillful changeover and look forward to seeing more of it from Powell. \\n Another fun touch comes between the stories. Scattered throughout the volume are advertisements done in the same 30s and 40s style as the rest of the comic. My favorite of these is the advert for the Billy Lobotomy Kit (contains one human head, one medical saw, a suture kit, and a manual entitled \"Removing the Vile Minions of Satan Through Cerebral Dissection\"). I imagine this could provide hours of fun for the whole family! \\n All in all, Nothin\\' But Misery was amusing and twisted enough to keep me reading, and the unique characteristics and possibilities of Powell\\'s world warrant a further look-see.', '(YA Graphic Novel) Awesome! Read upon recommendation of 10yo friend. Story and drawings are wonderful. I especially liked the author notes at the end of the book.', \"Even if the first volume seems a bit chaotic and you don't really know where the story is going it will get clearer and more complex with the following volumes. \\n Other than that I really think the characters and the style of drawing (same as in Trinity Blood) are more than enough to justify the purchase, because the characters are all just so sexy and somewhat insane xD (I think the author really wanted to live out her weird, naughty and pervy fantasies and I love it xD) \\n This series is definitely special, but if you like blood, creatures (demons, beasts, people with animal-like ears, tails, wings...), beautiful and detailed outfits(lace & latex!) and crazy characters (a violent sexy male character that looks like a woman, sexy half-naked guys & girls with lots of tattoos and piercings, a water demon that looks like a kid with razorlike teeth, a fighting nun with more skin exposed than covered...) you'll love it too. \\n What i like most about this manga is that it's not restrained but going all out in it's own unique craziness <3\", '3.75', 'This book is definitely very different from Fun Home in terms of what it covers. Instead of writing mostly about her childhood, Bechdel writes mostly about the process of writing Fun Home and her relationship with her mother as an adult. She also covers quite a bit about her time in therapy, and analyzes material about psychoanalysis. Although it sounds clinical, like Fun Home it is genuinely moving in the end and the drawings coupled with the words are evocative and lovely.', 'Recommended Companion Volume to Seattle Art Museum Graphic Masters Exhibit 2016. Short Intro. Complete Set. Not full size. More background and commentary would be helpful but beyond scope of dense tight structure.', 'File this one under \"Yet Another Awesome Thing\". Seriously, why couldn\\'t the new Constantine comic do these things that so many other current comics are achieving?', 'If you\\'re a Star Wars fan (I mean, who isn\\'t - right?), and you haven\\'t read anything by Jeffrey Brown, shame on you. \\n This book is the fourth in a series and one of the cutest in my opinion. \\n Jeffrey takes the classic Star Wars characters and turns them into children - with Darth Vader as the parent. In this book, it\\'s all about friends, sharing, and what a parent goes through on a daily basis. \\n It\\'s an extremely quick read - 10 minutes tops - but the appreciation is in the artwork and not any type of story line. \\n Some of the pictures would make really cool wall hangings - Jeffrey may want to consider making posters. For example, there is one of Chewbacca, Han, Leia, and Luke sitting on a rock looking out over a vast desert with a sunset in the background with the caption, \"I\\'ve got a good feeling about this.\" \\n I hope there will be more to follow.', 'Lol, even more \"guys with feminine hobbies!!!\" I feel like this series is being stretched thin by its concept. I wish Ryo had a bigger part or we got to see more \"girls with masculine hobbies!\" It\\'s still hilarious, though, and super cute art, so I\\'m here for it.', \"I really enjoy authors playing around with Batman's origin story, but it is geting to the point that there are so many retellings. So in a world overwhelmed with Batman's origin story this one does not rise to the top. \\n I did enjoy the art a great deal. I was kind of disappointed Dc didn't get a bigger name artist for this project bur the art was well done and the colossi were matched up perfectly. \\n The story was caught in the delimenia of not changing enough for the story to be greasy and changing too much to stay in line with what is considered canon. \\n While I was reading this I was saying to myself why is the story being spent of Gordon. It was not vital to the story and took us away from adding depth to the character of Batman. With that being said I actually enjoyed the development with Gordon the most. What a great interaction he has with his new partner. \\n Overall not bad, the major problem is there are similar books that are much better.\", 'TE-RRI-BLE lo que pasa en este volumen. Debe ser de los mejores que lei hasta ahora. Definitivamente, lo que da miedo son las personas y no los zombies. \\n El debate entre Eugene y Gabriel sobre la religion me gusto mucho.', 'Another graphic novel I picked up with the Dark Horse end of line sale with the Star Wars line. I remember reading the novel when it was first released. This was groundbreaking in the extension to Star Wars it created. Of course I have been curious to see what the comic version would be like. \\n After reading Shadows of the Empire, I was leery. Due to the gaps in the story I thought the same would happen here. Luckily, this did not happen. The comic does carry the whole story line over and almost all the situations and dialog. It matched what I remembered from reading. There are some details missing, but that is expected when switching types of storytelling. \\n The plot is about Grand Admiral Thrawn trying to restore the Empire. Within in the Expanded Universe, now Legends, he is the top villain. In the original novel here was a character that was an equal foe to the New Republic. In the comic you can see this, though the novel did a better job of presenting him. \\n The characterization of the familiar people is great. You do get a sense of time has passed and how things are progressing. Where the comic falls is the art work. I became use to the artwork, but the style was not to my taste. Everyone seemed lean and mean. A tad on the odd side. Also Leia did not look as pregnant as she did in the books. Granted some of the action would be interesting with her being pregnant. \\n Overall not a bad version of an outstanding book. Some points lost to the artwork and not as in depth of the book. Still an outstanding comic.', \"Jason Aaron sends Wolverine to Hell in this dark, ultra-violent arc that sees Logan's life put to the torch by the victims of his past attacks.

(I know why God does because he promises to reward the seed of a man who did deserve God's reward.) I probably am also extremely prejudiced as I think religion is __________.

We get a glimpse at some Suicide Girls in this volume and while it does serve to be more of a vehicle for SG during that chapter, it was still pretty decent.

The last Marvel comics I had read, however, were the Civil War books, and it doesn't seem like much has happened in between?\", \"For such a small library, my local one has quite a good selection of comics, graphic novels and manga. One of my most recent finds there was Batman: The Jira Kuwata batmanga, Volume 1 and as soon as I saw it, I picked it right up as though I had heard of Batmanga, I had never seen any. \\n Before I begin to review the actual content, I would just like to take a moment to tell you how absolutely beautiful the book itself was. The cover art was stunning and the paper used for the pages was amazing quality and so thick, it was such a joy to hold and read such a well made book. \\n The volume is a collection (the first 20 chapters) of Batmanga's written by Jira Kuwata written back in the 60's to bring Batman to the Japanese audience. The writing holds up incredibly as well as the art and reading it, it could have been written today. Adam West is my personal favourite portrayal of Batman (Michael Keaton is a close second), so having stories based on his character in the TV show was really good for me. \\n I love that only the cover page of each story is in colour and the rest of the pages are in black and white. It shows the skill of the artist to get so much detail and keep the readers eye while not using colour. \\n Each story is based on Batman and the Boy Wonder defeating a different enemy, the names of which are awesome (Dr. Faceless and Professor Gorilla as examples) but my absolute favourite name and story has to be the first one in the book about Lord Death Man. I love the slight cheesiness of it all and the incredible deductions Batman makes to solve each crime. \\n It really pained me taking such a wonderful book back to the library and I genuinely will be adding this book to my collection at some point in the future, as well as the other volume. \\n I started reading this book on the 6th of February 2015 and finished it on the 10th of February \\n For this and other reviews, check my blog http://lifeofanerdishmum.blogspot.co.uk/\", 'http://www.pussreboots.pair.com/blog/...', \"I think that MOST of the art in this series is really cute and enjoyable.
